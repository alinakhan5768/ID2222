I have had 3 back surgeries by the time I was 25yrs old. I have degenerative disc condition and on top of that I was involved in an accident at work which resulted in a herniated disc. I went through a discectomy, a spinal fusion, and a correction surgery. Needless 2 say I have A LOT of hardware in my back! Percocet was wonderful it made my recovery bearable &amp; living a some what normal life. Unfortunately I&#039;d been on it for 3yrs and then my doctor cut me off cold turkey &amp; told me 2 take Tylenol extra strength. The withdrawals are awful &amp; I&#039;m am still living in awful pain but I had 3 yrs with mild to no pain with Percocet!
I have a lot of metal in my spine and this helps a lot without making me drowsy or &quot;stoned&quot;. I can function almost normally on this medication, with the only things holding me back from normal function being the actual metal screws and the associated pains in the torn muscles and sciatic nerve. The pains are still there, but definitely a lot more manageable with the oxycodone. After a brief &quot;breaking in&quot; period my thinking processes returned to normal, with little to no losing track of thoughts or other side effects you might expect with a narcotic like this.
I knew going into it that the Mirena device was going to hurt, but being that I have a very high pain tolerance and have gotten used to lots of uterine pain (I&#039;ve had really heavy periods accompanied by intense cramping since I was nine), I really didn&#039;t think it would be all that bad. I was wrong! I&#039;m so glad I had my fiance drive me and pick me up to the actual insertion appointment; after I got it, the doctor asked me to sit up and I almost fainted. My blood pressure dropped and I thought I&#039;d be sick. It hurt a whole lot whenever I sat or bent over for the first week and a half to the point where I thought something was wrong and kept checking the strings to make sure it hadn&#039;t perforated. It works well and I love it now.. but the initial pain is BAD.
I have had the Implanon rod in my arm for two years. It made me have a period for 19 days and off for about 4 to 5. My hair was falling out, horrible cramps and bad headaches. I have switched over to the Lutera pill and instantly it has made a difference. I did have a little bit of tenderness in my breasts. Yes, I crave sweets. But who doesn&#039;t? My periods come the same day every month and are light and easy. I love this product. For the past six months it has been good to me.
I&#039;m a 26 year old female and I started taking this medicine along with a fluid pill on 01/25/08. At my heaviest weighing 317 lbs, I tried everything under the sun and lost maybe 10 lbs maximum here and there, but it always came right back. When I began this medication I weighed 308 lbs. Its 07/16/08 I weigh 218 lbs. That&#039;s a 90 lb loss from the date I started and 99 lbs since my heaviest. I do excerise for around an hour several times a week. I eat almost anything I want just in small portions. I cry when I look in a mirror.
I had OCD for 3 years. I could not sit down. I was eating while I was unable to concentrate on anything else than my thoughts. I would avoid going to the bathroom because I could not seat down on the toilet. In order to avoid my thoughts I was walking about 11 km per day. I would fall asleep thinking about something and in the next morning I would wake up thinking the same thing. I had the same exact thought for 3 days until something else stuck in my mind. I am taking 250 mg a day now and everything is good. The only think is that Coffee and Alcohol messes up the medication. One day after two coffees I had to take something else to calm my self down.
I Have had the implant for 4 months now, the first month i had no bleeding and thought it was wonderful, I am now on my 3rd period this month! Bled for 5 days had a week off bleed again for 6 days had 2 days off and bleeding again! Am considering taking it out. The only good use of it is not worrying about taking a pill everyday, but all these periods are interfering with not only my love life but aswell as my job.
I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for many years. The first year, I was prescribed 10 mg nightly. I had experienced a &quot;deep sleep&quot; and through the entire night. For the first time in my life, I didn&#039;t feel exhausted the next day. Then my dosage was changed to 5 mg, which was tough! My tolerance to the higher dose made it not work. My Dr. gave me something different to substitute while my body adjusted. It&#039;s not been 2 years, that I&#039;ve been taking the 5 mg. I also take Adderall XR @ 20 mg daily and 20 mg of Prozac. During the last 6 months, I&#039;ve had difficulty with memory. Being able to recall things I read, appointment times, things people had said to me. I am 52 years old, and I understand that comes with age. But has anyone had similar problems?
I had such high hopes for Strattera, but it was completely ineffective and actually made my condition worse. I wanted it to help me focus on work: sending emails, making phone calls, generally being able to work at a computer and other things. I started at 40mg a day, and found myself slightly more tired. I raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. Finally I went to 80mg and still no help with focus. I just found that I was lethargic, unmotivated and tired. I took naps and lazed around, but didn&#039;t get as excited about things as I had before the medicine. My job requires creativity, and it&#039;s hard to be creative if you&#039;re not excited about it. So I actually became LESS productive.
I&#039;m a 71 year old woman. Have vertigo and nausea that lasts for months. The Transderm-Scop patch helped off and on, but it is supposed to be worn on the neck and it would itch and leave a rash. So, I tried meclizine. No dizziness, but I can&#039;t get out of bed. Tiredness over comes me. Not sure what to try next.
Doesn&#039;t work! This is a totally ineffective inhaler. I gave it one star because I can&#039;t give it a lower rating.
I would be absolutely useless during my period and the pain from my &quot;episodes&quot;, as we have come to call them, would be so bad that I would actually go into shock. I took Yaz for a little over a year and LOVED IT. My periods were nearly pain-free, my skin looked AMAZING (even though it wasn&#039;t horrible before), and I had no definite side effects. I went from needing 2 Acetaminophen and 4 Ibuprofen every four hours or a Hydrocodone (for the pain) to needing nothing! The pain had gone from unbearable to a mild discomfort. I had no change in weight, and my moods were much more stable. My only side effect was mild &quot;rocky&quot; stomach the first few days after initially starting the pill. It worked great for me.
I broke out in blisters on face, scalp, and chest. These were oozing a clear sticky fluid that literally melted the skin it oozed over.  Tried everything over the counter and homeopathic but this flesh eating infection would not clear. Finally went to urgent care and was prescribed Bactrim for an assumed MRSA skin infection. Within The first 24 hours I had noticeable improvement. Sores weren&#039;t burning red and swollen, by 3rd day some scabs are already falling off with healthy pink skin underneath, no ooze, no new blisters. Day 5 you would hardly know I had a skin problem. All clear. Only side effect I had was loss of appetite. Didn&#039;t want to eat, nothing sounded good. Lost 4 pounds.  Not everyone reacts bad to Bactrim.
I started off with a sample pack of these and then I decided to be prescribed the birth control pills. MY MISTAKE. At first I liked the pill, I didn&#039;t adjust to it long enough I guess for all of the negative side effects to take place. Reading other peoples reviews made me feel A LOT better about what has been happening to me. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL. I used to be really happy all of the time and I was just starting to lose weight. This pill brought my weight loss to a complete halt.  This pill made me gain some weight back even though I was working really hard toward my weight loss goals. Also, this pill turned me into a crazy person, I get moody and cry for no reason. it is negatively effecting my long time relationship with my boyfriend.
Very effective for duodenal ulcer flare up. My only criticism is that they dissolve in your mouth before you can swallow any water to wash then down, and I have almost choked on them, which is very scary. The company needs to provide a thicker coating, even if it delays the quick effectiveness. I just coated one with butter and it went down more smoothly, with lots of ice water, but I still felt it hang up in my esophagus which almost made me gag. I think this could be dangerous. The other night it really scared me, as it got stuck on the way down, and I coughed and gagged and drank water but it was stubborn.
I have had reactions to three previous medications.I was hopeful with this one because it works differently.  Started on 100 mg. By day 7 I was starting to feel very fatigued 2 hours after taking the pill. Noticed decrease in urination and blurred vision. Symptoms worsened the next couple of days. Lasted 10 days. Guess I go back to my almost carb free diet.
I had high hopes for this treatment, but had terrible side effects including extremely high blood pressure and excruciating pains in my legs and lower back. I had to quit after 5 days because of these issues. This was 3 months ago and I still have back pain and tendinitis in my foot.
I have social anxiety disorder and depression. I never knew how unhappy and stressed I was until I started taking Zoloft early in the year. The drug did wonders for me. It brought out such happiness and a zest for life that I had not felt in a very long time. I began to exercise and eat right and as a result I lost a lot of weight. However, I stopped taking Zoloft mid year because my wife and I are trying to have another baby and it might affect fertility. A few weeks ago I got back on Zoloft for some anxiety I was feeling. I have done one week at 25 mg and the following two weeks on 50, but my anxiety is through the roof and I&#039;m very depressed. I hope it starts to work again, I&#039;m really anxious and praying I get my calm back.
GAH! it&#039;s 4:40 am and I&#039;m awake because my vagina BURNS and ITCHES. It feels worse than it did when I had my yi. I don&#039;t know if my symptoms are going to get better, but right now this is awful. Not worth it!!!!
I have re-occurring bouts of vertigo about 3-4 times a year.  It seldom lasts more than 14-20 hours but is severe at times, spinning surroundings, and feeling of falling backwards.  Usually the drowsy feeling stays with me for 2 days.  I have tried the natural remedies but find that Bonine or Meclizine works the best for me. I have had a hard time to find it over the counter the past year.
The key to using Alli is that you must list everything you eat and not exceed the amount of fat per meal.  I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects and am extremely pleased.  I lost 10 pounds before starting the program and hit a plateau, but since using Alli, I&#039;ve lost 27 more with only 13 pounds to go.  When I reach my ideal weight, I&#039;m going to continue the tracking, eventually weaning myself off of Alli, to be able to maintain my weight.  I don&#039;t expect a quick transition, but love the results.  I recommend trying it, but be diligent to follow the instructions for good results.
I am on 10mg of Brintellix, and have been for approximately 2 years. This med is a miracle worker for me, I am more stable than I have ever been. However, as a result I experience severe nausea as well as projectile vomiting, if taken after a large meal it is not as bad; within the hour after taking the medication I either feel like I am going to vomit or barely have time to make it to the toilet before vomiting. This is the one negative of this medication, so I have had to choose to deal with this in order to keep the positive outcome in dealing with my MDD; my whole life has changed since starting Brintellix. Vomiting/Nausea is a small price compared to just not living.
PTSD. Seemed to help some. Have bit of dizzy loopy for about 15 to 30 minutes after taking then ok. Was taking other meds and got sick and barfed often. Quit taking and nausea stopped. After a couple of months feeling quite anxious so started up Buspar again and anxiety seems to be very much calmed down. I plan to space meds out throughout day and find a schedule where my tummy doesn&#039;t feel so nauseated.
Man this stuff  taste horrible! Almost as bad as some thick cough syrup or Imodium or mylanta. I mixed mine with diet ginger ale ( of course with approval from my doctor). However, it managed to work very quickly. I was in the restroom within 20 mins after consuming it. No cramping , but I did gag a few times as I was drinking it . I managed to suck on lemons in between sips which also helped a lot. It works but the taste and then drinking the two bottles of water afterwards is tough! Beware.
I&#039;ve been taking ambien for over 6 years. It helps me sleep and I can sleep 6 hrs and felt like I slept 10 hrs only bad thing is once commit to taking ambien I can&#039;t be bothered cuz I won&#039;t remember so I usually lock my self down but it is a very helpful drug
On the first day I felt like death before taking the medicine. After taking day 1 (2 pills) around 630 pm I felt noticeably better by the morning, although I slept horrible (fever, uncomfortable wheezing).  I feel 4x better in the morning.... Took this medicine along with prednisone.
I started taking this 8 weeks ago, and after 4 weeks I got a period. I just assumed it was my body adjusting. It went away for about a week, but now I have been bleeding heavily for the past 3 weeks. This cannot be normal. My skin has gotten way worse and I have become very moody. 
Exceptionally good product to relieve mild dermatitis symptoms. It has come in 2 part: a large bottle of liquid and a capsule of the active ingredient. If you are not going to use the product immediately, tell the pharmacist to NOT mix the products for you. The solution is good only for 3 months from the date of mixing.
My skin dermatoligist prescribed me this drug to heal inflammation on the skin that was caused by mosquitos and left blisters &amp; deep wounds on my skin. She prescribed me methylprednisolone 8mg which I had to take 3x a day for 3 days... I had the whooping cough at the same time when I took this drug, I took Ambroxol before that but stopped when I took this drug. The pill did nothing much to me. I took it 2 times and then I stopped due to the side effects. After the pills my throat does not swallow properly and spitting out thick phlegm is difficult, I almost choked and was out of breath from my own phlegm when I tried to spit it out. It only stopped the pain in my leg but caused pain at other parts of my body. Not taking them again.
I am very much satisfied on the progressive action of janumet50/1000, my sugar which was above fasting- 200&amp; pp was 330, after taking janumet it came down to fp-96, pp-137...I take it twice a day, since my glucose levels are keeping normal ,will reduced the dose to 1500 per day.
Taken exactly as directed, worked wonders for colonoscopy prep.
Cipro is the only thing that works for me. I suffer from chronic urinary tract infections, despite my efforts of consistent 100% cranberry juice intake and using the bathroom after sex, I normally have 2-3 per year. Cipro usually kicks the awful urinary tract infection symptoms within a couple hours of my first dose, and I have complete relief within the first day. I&#039;m lucky enough to have the meds on-hand due to the recurrent infections - typically only take for 3 days unless I&#039;m seeing blood in my urine, then I take it for 5. Dose 500mg twice in the first day to kick the infection, and then I follow up with 500mg once per day through my 3 or 5 day. I don&#039;t usually have many side effects from the Cipro, maybe some fatigue and mild headache for a day but that&#039;s all.
I seemed to experience the regular side effects of LEXAPRO, insomnia, low sex drive, sleepiness during the day. I am taking it at night because my doctor said if it made me tired to take it at night. I assumed it would and started out taking it at night. Strange dreams, some pleasant. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Seems to be helping with the pain. Have had anxiety and depression in my family, and have tried quite a few other medications that haven&#039;t worked. Only have been on it for two weeks but feel more positive in my mind, want to accomplish more in my life. Hopefully the side effects will dwindle away, worth it to stick with it from hearing others responses. Great medication.
I have bpd, and it was a really rough start. My Dr had me on 27 different prescriptions in one year, and I was a total train wreck. Switched Dr&#039;s, and that one gave me a very high dose of benzos, and it almost killed me. Spent time in the icu for that one. Finally got the most amazing Dr now and he started me on gabapentin. It honestly saved my life.It is so hard to survive this illness when you cant get in under control. I had forgetten what it was like to be myself. I was angry and pissed off at everyone. It was so very hard on my husband and four little boys. I started with 300mg three times a day. The difference was amazing. I could smile and laugh. Thank you gabapentin for bringing me back!
I&#039;ve been taking a low dosage of this medication for four and a half months, and all it&#039;s done it make me unable to cry, heighten my anxiety, and cause me to wake up in the middle of the night, and render me unable to fall back asleep.
I had a great experience on Ocella. My insurances does full coverage of it for me so it&#039;s free every month, huge plus! I was also prone ever since my first period, which was pretty late, I would skip months at a time and then have terrible cramps, periods, and awful moods. Prescription midol couldn&#039;t even provide me with relief. I got on a BC that caused me to gain weight even though I was dieting and exercising and stopped it. I then a few months later got on Ocella. I have my period every month and lasts about 4 days. It&#039;s pretty heavy with minimal cramps. I haven&#039;t gained weight but I can seem to lose any either but that&#039;s not really a problem for me at this time. No out of the ordinary mood swings, sickness, or tiredness.
I have tried every diet under the sun, have worked with numerous personal trainers, and although I have been faithful 85% of the time on any diet I have been on, I have never been able to lose weight at a healthy rate. I normally have to do an extreme diet to see any progress and then my body will fight tooth and nail for the weight to come back. 3 months ago, I spoke to my doctor and she recommended Belviq because it has the least chance of side effects. I do have them though. For the first month, I would say headaches were pretty bad, but I would take Excedrin. But the tiredness that has lasted for the entire time, though it is not debilitating, it does effect my desire to work out. I have lost steadily though, 1.5-2pds a week at 1550 cal
I started out like the person probably reading these reviews, your trying to be optimistic about this product.  I started wearing all black, my confidence was gone. And this continued on through High School. I&#039;d go play pool at a friends house or play Basketball at his house and I&#039;d wear sweaters or hoodies to hide the stains. I went through every antiperspirant known, I even tried shaving my pits. Then just last week I tried Drysol for the first time. That night I put it on, I instantly regained confidence. Only the next day, it didn&#039;t seem to work. First day of grade 11. Sure I was nervous. So I gave it a go again, and from there on out, I&#039;ve been dry. So give this product some time to work. I give you my word, this product will work.
You have to find what works best for you with Linzess and when you do, you will LOVE this drug.  I&#039;ve had irritable bowel with severe constipation for all my adult life.  My insurance does not cover this drug yet I am willing to pay for it.  I have lost weight and no longer feel bloated all the time.  Before Linzess, Miralax was the only thing that even barely worked (after a few days).  Another commenter is right, if you take it more than 1/2 hour before eating (I wake up and take it in the wee hours of the morning or as soon as I wake up.)  The earlier you take it, the more the bowel movement will contain a lot of water as well.  A cup of coffee in the morning can jumpstart it.
My arm burned and itched all the time and I had a extremely pain full period that lasted months non-stop the length of the time it was in my arm
I have been going through some really tough times, job loss and a terminally ill partner and I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety as a result.  My Dr prescribed Zoloft.  If anything Zoloft made things worse, I tried sticking it out for three months but the ongoing nausea, increased anxiety, jaw clenching, restless legs and insomnia were just too much to cope with along with everything else.  It also numbed me and made me very indifferent to things.  To cut a long story short I stopped after three months and have changed to Citalopram.  Citalopram has lifted my mood without all of the side effects I experienced on Zoloft.
It has help me to grow hair back on my head and assist in breast growth
I was prescribed Champix by my doctor and started on the them on the 12th January. I had to pick a date as a quit date, I chose the 25th Jan. I was a heavy smoker for over 20 years and on 2 packs of 20 a day (awful) I am proud to say I am a non smoker after taking Champix for just 12 days. To me this medicine is a pure miracle, I have to finish my tablets which were to last for 14 days. I have had headaches and really bad dreams that have woken me but I can live with that, I have no cravings at all to smoke and the thought of it does make me feel a bit of nausea. I just pray this last&#039;s as it truly is a miracle medicine.
Great! My daughter has had a cold and cough to the point of vomiting a few times. After the Dr checked her to make sure nothing serious, gave her this and she felt immediately better. Coughing and congestion significantly reduced. Bromfed is amazing and tastes good too (I always try anything I am going to give my children).
I see a lot of mixed reviews on this. It&#039;s obvious this drug is EXTREMELY helpful on some and on others its completely ineffective, and can even do harm. My suggestion is to try it out for a month. If you don&#039;t feel the effects of it, try it for another month and if you still don&#039;t then switch to another drug. If you start feeling agitated by it, get off it immediately. For me strattera has worked wonders. I am 18 years of age, and have noticed the effects after my 4th week of taking it. My mind feels clearer, and I feel more motivated to focus on things I would usually find boring. The effects are reflected in my ACT score: my score has gone up a whole 6 points since first taking it. I wholeheartedly recommend strattera to anyone with ADD.
So, I feel like this did help stabilize me a little bit (with depressive states), but I ended up getting acne and redness all over my face. I also had my eyes feel all weird and twitchy. Overall, It was not super effective for me because I still had horrible anxiety and panic attacks and I could not titrate high enough to get effective coverage from the medication without weird side effects. I was only on 75mg maximum, mind you.
My Dr had put me on the Losartan. Right after I started taking it, my whole back was in so much pain. I had told my Dr about the pain and I believed it was the Losartan. He said I had a physically demanding job. Keep taking it. After being in so much pain, I couldn&#039;t work I emailed him and explained my pain. He said there has been no case studies of it causing back pain to keep taking it. After telling him three times I was in pain due to this medicine and he still would not help me I am switching Drs. Yes, it lowered my blood pressure but the back pain I was having is NOT worth it!
Have only used Lasix a few days and have already noticed a big difference.
Seeks to be working well, had 3 teeth extracted, and my dentist prescribed this medication due to the slight swelling prior to the extraction, which has gone done down considerably, along with the major pain and pressure that accompanied it before.
I started using this product a little more than a week ago.  I applied it three nights in a row as instructed, and went to a party the next day to test it out.  I still sweated, but not nearly as much, and I had hope that with time I would be totally sweat free.  I applied it once again the following night, only to continue to sweat the next day.  Since then (It&#039;s been about four days) I have applied hypercare every night without any improvements in the amount I sweat.  Today was the first day of school and I was sweat the entire day, unable to lift my arms at all for fear of the odor and stains.  I feel so hopeless now and don&#039;t know what to do.
Ativan is wonderful for dealing with a stressful job, failing marriage, aging parents and restless leg. My doctor prescribed this medication for me so I can relax at night. I was well rested and the next day I felt more energized.
I started Trinessa in mid Sept. I am taking it primarily for acne. While I was on Trinessa my acne didn&#039;t get better until almost 3 mos. later. I noticed some improvement in overall skin tone and complexion that I hadn&#039;t seen before, which is nice. But I gained about 6-7 lbs, and I feel bloated almost all the time. I have been working out hard for a month now, watching what I ate even MORE and I have lost a mere 2 lbs.... extremely disappointing. This pill may have made me more irritable and PMS-y at times, my periods are the same, not lighter. I really hate the fact that I eat so healthy and work out so much and see no improvements in my body. I&#039;ve never had to work so hard to lose even 2 lbs, so I&#039;m switching to Yaz.
This is the only medicine in 3yrs of having Occipital Neuralgia that REALLY WORKS!!!
Works well on me and my children. I have found it works in a few days. I have used it for chest infections and middle ear, and had great results with all my family.
Back in 2011, after having and IUD and having several back to back UTI&#039;s I had to see a specialist. This specialist prescribed Bactrim. Well on the third day of taking this medicine, I woke up, tried to get out of bed and fell to the floor. I realized I couldn&#039;t walk, couldn&#039;t see straight and I felt very weak. I ended up having to go to the Emergency room only to find  out that this medicine was taking the blood and bone marrow out of my body. I had to have two blood transfusion after this medicine.
After only 3-4 days I was immediately better. I couldn&#039;t believe it because my doctor had put me on all sorts of medicines before this one and Buspar SAVED my life! The only side effect I noticed with it was that 30 minutes after taking it I was a little dizzy but it went away after a half hour and I was finally stress free with no panic or anxiety attacks.
Leveled out my moods, but very constipating and I still have no energy.
I first started with Lo Loestrin and had a terrible experience with it the first month or so. I then switched to Minastrin to see if my body can handle it. The first few months were great, no crazy side effects and my period was super light- no cramps and lasted about 4 days at most. About a month and a half ago that&#039;s when it got worse. I have a headache every single day.. Constant dizziness and fatigue. I&#039;m a personal trainer so it&#039;s my lifestyle to eat right and train almost everyday. I noticed I&#039;m not losing any fat, instead I gained about 3lbs and constantly feel like I&#039;m retaining water. As I type this I have a throbbing headache on the left side of my head. All I want to do is sleep and even if I take Advil my pain does not go away.
I have been on this pill for 3.5 years and it is my FAVORITE THING EVER. My periods are extremely light, I almost never have cramps or mood swings, and the only weight gain I experienced was welcome and came in the form of a cup size. I haven&#039;t had any problems during that time of the month or otherwise and overall, I think this is just a very nice, happy pill. I always use condoms because I&#039;m paranoid but I&#039;m scare-free also!
Wellbutrin was a miracle drug for me. The first time I ever remember experiencing &quot;normal&quot; was after I started taking it.  The only side effects I had were having vivid, movie like dreams, and losing a ton of weight. The dreams were so great, I didn&#039;t want to wake up, and the weight loss was a dream come true.  
I&#039;m suffering from Tinea Cruris for over 3 months now. Tried different remedies. Non of them worked. Tried topical creams such as Clotrimazole, Dactarin, Lamisil. None of them bring any relief. After consultation with my GP I took a liver function blood test and when the results came satisfying I was prescribed 200mg of Sporanox/Itraconazole for 1 week. No effect was noticed during the drug course although after few days fungus started to disappear from my penis head. Week after everything came back with a &quot;double kick&quot; the rash from my groin did not go at all. Everything is the same. Side effects: After the course I felt very tired and nervous but this went off after couple of days. Now I have to look for some other solution!!!
I took this when I had acute externa otitis media. My ear was hurting really badly and it was swelled up. I couldn&#039;t sleep on the side of the affected ear, couldn&#039;t open my jaw wide enough to eat/yawn. It was horrid. I was prescribed 10 tabs (twice a day) and after my prescription, the swelling reduced significantly and also my skin looks amazing. I do not have any side effects. But I love what this medicine has done to my skin especially. I do get very bad breakouts at time, especially when I keep my make up on for too long. Even my colleagues commented on how clean my face looks at the moment. 
I had the Mirena IUD placed in July of 2007, 6 months after my husband and I had our first baby. My doctor recommended it over the Paraguard. When the doctor was placing it, I was extremely uncomfortable. However, I felt back to normal after two days. There was mild spotting for the first couple of weeks, but that stopped. Then my period stopped. In fact, I haven&#039;t seen my period since 2007. I haven&#039;t felt any different since I had it placed. The only thing that could be a bother about this is the strings, it feels like fishing line. The doctor said the strings would soften over time and they did within the first year. I love Mirena!
I have had 2 Paraguard IUDs. Took the 1st one out to get pregnant, got the 2nd after my daughter was born. Both times, I had heavier periods, but it seemed better than hormonal birth control that makes me crazy. After 2 and a half years, I started having strange side effects. Lots of acne, dry skin, swollen lymph node, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, hopelessness. My doctor said that my swollen lymph node is associated with the liver. My acupuncturist said she thought I had liver congestion. I researched excess copper in the body. ALL. MY. SYMPTOMS. Had it removed within 2 days. Felt immediately better. My acne started healing within a few days. Not feeling depressed anymore. It was great until it wasn&#039;t.
I&#039;ve been on high dose pain medicines since 2001 and knew I had constipation as a side effect, but it wasn&#039;t until I was able to lose a large amount of weight that I realized just how backed up and bloated I was. I heard of this medication online and asked my pain management Dr for it. He had no issues giving it to me. It took me a couple weeks to get the nerve to try it because of the side effects I&#039;ve read, but I&#039;ve not had any. This medication has been a Godsend! It was recommended to use a laxative prior to help clean things out some, which decreases cramping from your body trying so hard to defecate. I now look forward to my injection every other day! I only need to go every other day because it works so well.
I started Saxenda on April 1st. My starting weight was 249 and I am 205 today. I have no side effects at the 3 mg. dose because my body is used to the drug by now. You have to eat clean and small portions.No cheating!
I like one of the other reviewers has taken Nortrel 1/35 in place of Necon 1/35 due to lack of med at the pharmacy. I was told that it&#039;s literally the same thing but a different company. I am so glad that I stumbled across this forum because it explains the abnormal symptoms that I&#039;m experiencing. I&#039;ve been taking it 2 weeks today. The past few days I haven&#039;t had an appetite at all. I have to force myself to eat. Also, complete loss of interest in sex. As a newlywed...Not a good thing. I also noticed the dryness with sex as well which has never been a problem for me. I will be stopping this med immediately! The pros are not worth the cons.
I&#039;ve had my IUD for about 3 months. The insertion was a lot more painful than I expected and I had bad cramps for a couple days afterward. It was overall not bad seeing as it last for 5 years. I gained about 10lbs when I first got it but have been able to lost about 6 of those with diet and exercise changes. I do have pretty extreme mood swings but they are getting better as I think the hormones are working themselves out! I have an increase in sex drive for sure!!
I have been on Skyla for 8 months. I read many negative reviews that horrified me. I am VERY happy with my IUD! Inserting it hurt, and the next few days I felt like I was having a really bad period. I had minor spotting first month. I had a minor 2-4 day period the first three months. Since then my period has completely stopped. I have even lost the weight I put on from birth control pills, and my sex drive has increased. I sincerely recommend trying Skyla
If you&#039;re here looking for reviews of this pill that your doctor gave you like I was almost a year ago, I would advise you not to read through them and just try it out yourself. I read these reviews and was terrified of this pill but, for me, it honestly has made no difference in my life besides not being pregnant. The first couple of weeks I felt a little bloated, had some heart burn, and breast tenderness but these symptoms were not by any means terrible and 100% went away. Other than those first 2-3 weeks, I have experienced nothing aside from a normal day to day life and highly recommend this pill! Everybody is different though, so seriously, don&#039;t scare yourself reading reviews and just try it out yourself :)
I have been taking this medicine for four days now and have had nausea, and insomnia.  However, last night after taking my medicine in the early evening, my heart started beating rapidly and my chest felt very tight.  I took my emergency inhaler just to be sure my asthma wasn&#039;t acting up (hasn&#039;t acted up in years). My breathing got a little better afterwards but my heart rate was still up there. I will be consulting my physician today. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a great medicine.
So just like everyone who&#039;s basically commented, I had unprotected sex with friend of mines (I know VERY stupid) on. VERY drunken night.. Of course he came inside me &amp; to make matters even worse I was ovulating around the time, so about 11 hours later I rushed to Cvs and bought the aftera pill.. Trust me when I tell you it was the LONGEST two weeks ever!!!!!!! I googled every possible pregnancy symptom, every possible side effect of the aftera pill which are basically one in the same but finally just  when I decided I&#039;d buy an early response prego test my period comes, which it came two days early.. But I&#039;d rather early than NEVER.. So it works but trust me when I tell you it&#039;s not fool proof so just save yourself the time &amp; get bc..
After thinking that antidepressants were just a huge money maker for the pharmaceutical industry. I was prescribed 2mg of Abilify in combination with Wellbutrin (300mg), and 10mg of Prozac, I feel like a new man. I just hope that the effects don&#039;t wear off over time.
I am taking Sertraline. Started about two months ago. It is a Rolla coaster. 50mg for now. Depression for me is a 30 year battle. I like the numbness it brings at times.
It is very effective.
It keeps me very stable. My only gripes are that there&#039;s a really bitter taste if it gets stuck to your tongue, the shape is ridiculous to swallow (It&#039;s like a pentagon lol) and my psychiatrist didn&#039;t know that there is more and more info coming out that suggests that it interacts with the birth control pill. My little one is 2 weeks old and she definitely wasn&#039;t planned. I took the pill perfectly too. Just a heads up :)
Stay away from this devil, I&#039;ve had it for 2 years and in that time I&#039;ve had the worse experience of my life and didn&#039;t even know it was from my birth control! It&#039;s caused me 2 have serious  stomach  issues with pain &amp; seseitvity back &amp; for to docs 2 see why I&#039;m always in pain can puke at any time I want just like I was pregnant.my head is always pounding my hair is oily &amp; I&#039;ve gained over 50 pounds and I&#039;m very active even though I have no energy I make myself walk or hike a lot! Sex what&#039;s that this makes me sick to think about being touched.but I did get it removed today I will say I&#039;m having serious leg cramps just like I did when I first got it..at that time I blamed it on work but I&#039;m now shown it was from the BC ..Don&#039;t get it!
Bipolar, ADHD, OCD, etc. Many of the symptoms overlap and crossover into each other and others as well. Depression is found in each condition, and I find for myself that depression is by far the most debilitating condition of all. I first tried Paxil 12 years ago for depression and anxiety. The Paxil worked great. The side effects included a little nausea (which is basically eliminated by eating something with or soon after taking the med) and some sexual issues (which I believe can be negotiated after you get used to the Paxil). I quit taking it when I switched insurance and because of the perceived stigma I had with taking anything for conditions I didn&#039;t want to even acknowledge. Now I&#039;m back on it and will keep it up!
I changed from the POP to Loestrin about a month ago specially to clear up spots, it is great if you want a regular light period however don&#039;t go near it if you&#039;re looking for acne relief! Has made my face go from a few pimples to a horrible mess! Also has caused some uncomfortable and not nice looking bloating :( Managed to change pills and recommend Doxycyline for Acne relief instead of the pill as none of these side affects and works well!
Pt. 1: This birth control started ruining my life. I only took it for 3 weeks because I couldn&#039;t stand it anymore. Literally on day 3 I started getting powerful migraines, I couldn&#039;t sleep from them, my eyes would tear up, I started taking at least 4 Advil on the daily for them to be BEARABLE. Then I started feeling like pure rubbish, even more depressed than before.  I wanted to slap everyone around me. You couldn&#039;t even talk to me. Now on to my face My Face  Broke Out Like Pure Hell. I&#039;ve been off of it for a week and the breakouts on my jaw (and even around my nose which never happened) are plentiful and SO RED.
I&#039;m a 47 yr old overweight female.  I&#039;ve had high blood pressure my entire life but never cholesterol issues.  I went in for blood work in Jan. 16 and was shocked to learn my LDL-p (particle count) was off the charts at 2,800 (should be 700 range) and my LDL small particle count was 1,500 (should be under 500).  Additionally all my blood lipids were way out of range.  I was given 40 mg of atorvastatin but after reading how horrible statins were, I got scared and only took 1/2 daily.  I just got my labs redone and since January-April (3 full months), all my blood lipids are in normal, optimal range.  I did alot of research on the effectiveness of lower dose statins and have not had any issues with taking 1/2 my pill daily.  Results speak.
Being using Breo for a month and it&#039;s working like a treat. I have cut down on the blue puffer by 50% which is great, I don&#039;t get a huge lecture from the pharmacist for using my blue puffer frequently, which is good.
I am a Type 2 Diabetic who has lost 41 pounds in 3 months. Qysmia is extremely effective, having substantially lowered my desire for food. Side effects are dry mouth, heartburn, constipation, restless sleep and metallic taste to food. I would readily recommend Qsymia to you for weight loss. It works!
Made me nauseous.
I was out on a very low dose for unexplained right upper quadrant pain. I can not believe the difference this has made. Not only for the pain, but I was also starting to go into depression because they can&#039;t figure out what is causing my pain. After being hospitalized my gastro recommended I try it along with getting into pain management. I very rarely have to take a pain pill. I actually went 2 weeks without a pain pill. I&#039;m very pleased with my results.
DO NOT GET THIS! UNLESS-you&#039;re crazy. Has caused-painful breast lumps (still awaiting my ultrasound results from my breast doc), thyroiditis (an inflammed thyroid), thyroid nodules, severe migraines, AWFUL periods (almost all the time, heavy, far more uncomfortable than usual), terrible back pain, fatigue, weight gain, acne. Not to mention the person who inserted it put it too deep, so the first removal attempt was unsuccessful, I have to go back and get it removed with use of Xray/Ultrasound. Huge regret. Not worth the detrimental blow to my health. Prior to getting this-I was HEALTHY. No health problems (aside from the occasional seasonal allergies.) 3 months after insertion-everything went to hell. Coincidence. I (&amp; my doc) think not.
I don&#039;t understand all the complaints about the taste.  Sure, it&#039;s not my favorite, but wasn&#039;t awful (maybe they didn&#039;t dilute as instructed). Slammed 16 ounces down like a frat boy at a party and bam! Started working fairly gently real soon.
I just started taking 10mg Celexa the evening of Jan 14, took another one same time next night. Next morning I was miserably sick. Nausea, more wretching than vomiting, weak, headachey, all over sick feeling... This was like (but this time much worse) the reaction I had when I started Prozac. Dr. agreed that my first bad reaction WAS to the Prozac, called yesterday and said I won&#039;t take more Celexa. I am done with SSRI&#039;s. I am wondering if anyone else has had this same reaction...
Excellent results with no side effects.
I took this drug for several weeks and my GERD cleared up.  Then, out of the blue, I became moody and angry at everyone.  I read up on some of the side effects and found that mood issues have been associated.  I tend to have this when I take anything that amps up your metabolism so it must contain something that is somewhat related to that.
After being disgusted with my constant weight gain, I decided to try the Real Adipex-P and not  the generic version of it. The generic  gave me really bad mood swings and made my heart flutter a lot but the Real brand has worked totally different feeling. I began on June 9th at my all time high weight of 345.4. I have found that once I chose to eat clean and refrain from beef,pork, sodas, and anything white; I got a better outcome. I have to say that we are all different and any weight loss is a plus.  I am not boasting but I am happy to report that I weighed in today and I weighed 313.6!! That&#039;s a little over 30 pounds in 5 days shy of a month.  Ya&#039;ll,  we can do this. We must not give up and stop trying! I am striving for 150 pounds.
The cream works wonderfully.  It is a little bit hot and you really feel the burn. The outcome is worth it but it is CRIMINAL how much the drug company charges for this medication!!!  It has been around since 1957 and in 2009 it cost $157.00 per tube, today it costs $2,865.00.  Absolutely abuse!
worked like a charm for pain and anxiety for migraines you have to start slow and get used to it after that its better than mothers milk and a safe alternative to oxys opama ext   old school drug when people were responsible and didn&#039;t need so much control,,,,,do they still make it in the old form ,,,don&#039;t drive tho remember
I have been on Belviq for eight months and have lost 59 pounds. Obviously my weight loss has been dramatic with little or no side effects. I am so pleased with the results of this medication.
Took one yesterday because i&#039;ve had a persistent cough for almost 3 weeks. I literally could not breathe after taking this. I had shortness of breath until I went to sleep and it scared me. I don&#039;t know if this is a common side effect but definitely staying away from this although I wished it had worked. Also, I didn&#039;t stop coughing once.
Got a trial prescription for Nuvigil 150mg tablets, first day was incredible, but after a few days the effectiveness was greatly diminished.  Still worked but did not have the same effect as day one.  Worried about using it regularly since it is not covered by insurance and without that the cost is outrageous ($330/30 tablets).  Does not leave you nervous like Ritalin, and lasts longer than Provigil. Worth trying if your health care plan covers it.
I am 18 and I&#039;ve been on Concerta for just over a year now, and I took an extra year of high school to catch up, I went from a 60 in math to a 90, I felt like I had a whole new brain. Like others, I was a funny, outgoing, active person but I now find myself completely content with being alone, infact I prefer it. I easily become irritated by spending time with others. I&#039;ve also experienced uncontrollable mood swings, and I spend a lot of time crying. Lately, I&#039;ve been losing focus though regardless and my dosage is already at 54mg. I&#039;m so happy with my grades, and in the beginning I was myself, but in the past few months I&#039;ve become a machine, and all I think about is how much work I need to do.
I have been taking Elmiron for about 7 years for interstitial cystitis. It had no effect on me for the first 6 months but then suddenly began to work very well. I had trouble remembering to take it 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating and would skip it if I forgot. I gradually realized that one 100mg dose a day was just as effect as taking three, so I changed to that as my goal dosage. I have experienced some hair thinning at the crown of my head, but since I am 70 years old I cannot be sure that was caused by Elmiron. When there was a mysterious halt in manufacture of the drug several years ago that lasted for several months before resumption, the symptoms of interstitial cystitis reappeared after a couple of weeks.
I took my first dose on May 10th, I dropped 9lbs immediately within the first 4 days without exercise, my side effects the first 3 days were dry mouth, excessive energy, slight difference in my heart rate, clammy and insomnia. Day 5 has been totally different and I started going to the gym again today.  My heart rate was still slightly higher and I ask have problems sleeping but everything else went away. I dropped 2 more pounds today from mowing the lawn and walking the treadmill for thirty minutes. I do have to make myself eat I&#039;m never hungry. I eat 6 times per day counting in at about 2000 calories a day. I watch my carb and sugar intake, but eat lots of dietary fiber and protein. My goal is 150 lbs, I started at 207 and I&#039;m now 196lbs.
I am in the UK and therefore am &#039;lucky enough&#039; not to have paid for my treatment. However I understand this is a relatively expensive drug for the National Health Service to prescribe. I have had two six monthly doses and I will certainly not be having the third and that is despite having severe osteoporosis . I have experienced no positive results from this drug, only debilitating pain, stiffness and general flu&#039; like symptoms which come and go regularly day and night with no prior warning. My worst experience was a spot on my lower jaw bone that grew until it literally erupted, leaving a 2mm diameter hole in the side of my face. ( 2 months of antibiotics ) I can find no positive feedback to justify this drugs side effects.
Today is my 4th day on the 4-week titration. I&#039;m starting the 25mg today. The first 2-days I felt a burning in the back of my throat. By the third day it was considerably less. On the the second day (12.5mg) I already began to feel the benefits of the medications. The pain had subsided and my energy was back! The extreme burning sensation in my upper back was gone. I&#039;m hopeful that this medication will help me return to work. I still have the pain in my hands. The only con is the excessive sweating primarily in the evening. I&#039;m hoping this will subside. On day two my head was drenched but I had energy and my pain level went from an 8 to a 4. I wil continue to update my progress.
I have been taking this for about 6 or 7 months now and I don&#039;t think I will continue after I finish this pack. At first I would get very very nauseous at night before bed, making it a little difficult to fall asleep. My emotions are all over the place. I am super sensitive to everything, very easily irritated and oh my god I cry so much. I cry A LOT. I mean, I cry during commercials, those facebook videos about good samaritans or sick kids, during movies, or if someone says anything even just slightly mean to me. Sometimes, I cry for no reason at all. In fact, I&#039;m crying right now as I&#039;m writing this, and have been crying for the past 3 hours and I can&#039;t pin point exactly why. On the bright side, I am not pregnant, so it does do its job
Wanted to share a positive story on here! I love the Paragard and recommend it to everyone I know. I am currently 21, got my Paragard inserted in July 2014 when I had just turned 19. Never been pregnant or given birth. I had never been on birth control because I didn&#039;t want to use hormonal birth control or take a pill everyday. Gyno prescribed Misoprostol to take before the process, which I believe really helped with insertion. The IUD failed to insert twice, but went through the third time, and I&#039;ve had NO problems since! Works perfectly with a steady boyfriend, I love the long-term use and no hormones. I highly recommend for young women who don&#039;t want to have children until their late 20&#039;s/early 30&#039;s!
I recently had a laparoscopic hysterectomy.  As some of you may know, anesthesia from surgery can cause the bowels to basically just stop moving.  Add to this the trauma of surgery in a nearby region, combined with taking narcotics, and I was MISERABLE.  It took 3 days for it  to work, but when it did it was a major miracle.  I did not realize constipation could be so bad you&#039;d consider that you might DIE.  Miralax not only works, but it does not give you the horrible sick cramps you get with stimulant laxatives.  Just the best ever.
I&#039;ve been taking this Amoxicillin penicillin medicine for about 4 days now and I take it every 12 hours I seem to feel a little better after the second day I know I can now breathe in and take full breath it doesn&#039;t hurt like it was my chest made me feel like I was having a heart attack but I think that this might be the key to this upper respiratory infection I had gotten from an air conditioner that had black mold in it and it really made me sick but I think that I&#039;m going to continue taking the medicine which was the course of 7 days. I also have not had any problems with diarrhea I do eat drink milk before I take the medicine so I think its okay even though I feel like my stomach is bubbly.
I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was about 19yr.s old and am 45 now. I have been on numerous medication, too many to count and I started taking latuda about 3 weeks ago. I also take trileptal, lamictal, litium, and prozac, and vyvance, and I can&#039;t begin to tell u how much better I feel. It just amazes me. I haven&#039;t snapped at anyone in a couple of weeks, my mood is the most stable its been in 20yrs. I actually like to be around people again. I&#039;m not full of hate and anger. I have dealt with some serious nausea, vomiting, and headaches so it is very important to eat at least the recommended amount of calories, and its much better if I take it at night. I am very grateful I was willing to try latuda. Thank u.
I have trouble keeping it sealed all sides I have to use tape lost 3 patches
I&#039;ve been on this med for 9 months. I&#039;m also on Victoza, 2000mg Metformin. My a1c has dropped from upper 7&#039;s to 6.5. Blood pressure readings have dropped to normal range. I&#039;ve always had issues with male yeast infections and was concerned when I first started this medicine. I apply a steriod/antifungal cream at the slightest hint of redness, this has kept the issue under control. The more sugar you consume, the more you will urinate. I think I have mentally reduced my sugar intake just knowing that. I&#039;ve lost over 30lbs also.
The only high blood pressure medicine that really helped, BUT due to the price going off the charts, and no insurance, I&#039;ve had to take a different medicine and suffer with headaches.
I starting taking Zoloft after speaking to my doctor about my problems -- irritability, sadness, loss of sex drive, poor body image, etc.  She suggested we try this medication for one year at 50 mg a day.  Within 2.5 weeks, I started feeling better. I wasn&#039;t mad all the time and even managed to have sex again after a nine month hiatus. I felt much more confident and in control of my emotions. I even managed to lose 15 pounds and am still losing. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever.
If it wasn&#039;t for having to stay out of the sun while taking, I&#039;d give it a 10.  I was given this for something besides my ears at the time, but I clearly remember that it suddenly and quickly cleared up a long standing issue with my ears being slightly sore for quite a long time.  My doctor at the time told me to remember that.  I seem to have the ear issue again and am thinking of asking my current pcp for at least a short time treatment with this.
After 5 full days on Belviq I can assure you this is going to be a wildly successful product. It has made sticking to a diet of reduced portions and healthier foods EASY. I can now eat half what I used to and feel completely full. It has eliminated my compulsion to snack when watching tv or a movie and the results are already noticeable. I started Belviq weighing 227 and as of this morning I was at 222 (after only 5 days). I&#039;m not starving myself, just eating the amount I should have been eating for the last decade. The only side effects I have noticed thus far is being able to fall asleep faster and having a more upbeat and positive attitude in general.
So far, my experience has been so so. Let me explain myself. I am 17 years old (almost 18, don&#039;t worry), my starting weight was 219, and I have PCOS, Hashimoto&#039;s, and I think I even have something else, I just can&#039;t think of it at the time. I have literally tried EVERYTHING to lose weight. Everything. But nothing would help. This year I have at least stayed within the same 10 pounds which I have heard is normal. My doctor put me on the two week low dosage of this medicine and it didn&#039;t do anything for me. No side effects, nothing. The first week on the highest dosage I didn&#039;t have anything either. Now I am ending my second week on the highest dosage and I am losing about .5-.8 pound a day! Hopefully these results continue :)
I just started taking Celexa and the only thing I notice are the headaches, which are very unusual for me. Sometimes they are worse than others. Can be distracting at work, but not so bad that I&#039;m willing to through in the towel just yet. Also my stomach as been a little upset too, but again not enough to give up on trying to feel better!
Works consistently... when other nausea medicines didnt work at all.
STAY AWAY FROM XANAX. Please!! It will help you -- in the moment. But literally hours later, the rebound anxiety and insomnia will hit you and make you regret taking it at all in the first place. And before you know it you&#039;ll go from half a bar to multiple bars just to sleep at night. Oh, and the increased despersonalizion and dark thoughts are not potential &quot;side effects&quot; -- they are some of the many very real, consistently DIRECT EFFECTS of taking Xanax. Benzos should be used as rarely and as short-term as possible. Even in these cases the withdrawal is VERY real...it hurts just to live. Please. Take my word for it. I&#039;m going through it for the TENTH time right now. ADDICTIVE
Been on it about 5 weeks. 300mg. No yeast infections. Yes peeing more, but for me it is a more normal amount. Before I had to force myself to drink, rarely felt real thirst,  and always felt I retained water especially from eating carbs. Now I drink more and pee more, but manageable. Once at night only.  The best thing I noticed is more energy and slow but sure weight loss on a more normal amount of food. Lost 8lbs so far and waking up in the morning is easier.  More energy means more exercise too. So far, so good. Love it, feel more normal like I did when I was younger
I have a very high tolerance for meds (all meds) always have, even as a child.  Woke up in the middle of surgery at 7, after give twice the adult dosage bc I couldn&#039;t go to sleep.  I noticed on opiates they help but minimally.  I noticed for a brief period when I had benzo&#039;s for my anxiety, it aided my pain meds.  But they took me off for another kind and my opiates for pain and anxiety relief weren&#039;t being helped at all.  They just switched me and I notice the same aid to my medication the benzo&#039;s provided minus the fog.  It doesn&#039;t help with my severe chronic pain on its own (I wish it were that easy) but I find that my meds works so much better in conjunction.  My gabipentin seems to work better too. :) finally I can live a little better
I had sores on my palm that just would not heal for several weeks.  Finally used Halobetasol Propionate Cream 0.05%.  It healed in about a week.  I have other less powerful creams and so I only use this cream when nothing else works.  Once it works, I switch to less powerful creams for awhile.  I then switch to using Dove Sensitive skin and Vanicream.  It is really powerful but should be used only when nothing else works.
The first night I was nauseated, but thought it was just from the sinus infection. Two nights later I started to itch all over, thought maybe it was something else and have been itching ever since (2 days ago). Also have thrush. I have been eating yogurt and it&#039;s not doing anything for it. I suppose the itching isn&#039;t as bad as the pain, but it&#039;s equally as annoying.
I have suffered from cold sores my entire life. Abreva is the only thing that works for me. It is a miracle drug! I also start taking L-lysine at the first sign of a cold sore. the two things in combination have turned me lifelong suffering into a barely noticeable minor irritation. The only complaint I have is the new pump bottle which dispenses more cream than needed. The medicine is too expensive to waste like that.
I am 21, no kids. On my period I came in to my OBGYN and she numbed me up on the inside and proceeded with the process. I will tell you right now, It was the MOST painful 15 seconds I have experienced. It felt like your worst period cramp x15. When she was done the pain dulled but never completely left. I had bad cramps for days. Along with cramps I had diahrrea for the rest of the day and bleeding for the next 3 weeks. The only thing that stopped the bleeding was more birth control! Cramps are severe and haven&#039;t stopped in the 2 months, and get as bad as the insertion feeling. My nipples are so painful! I have to wear a bra 24/7 to stop the pain! Worst part? Sex has become VERY painful. Had an ultrasound, everything is &quot;perfect.&quot; Not for everyone!
My doctor prescribed Contrave for me after my annual visit early April 2016. Prior to this appt, I&#039;ve been trying to eat healthier &amp; exercise more. When I started, I weighed 264 pounds. Following the prescribed directions, I felt good the first 3 weeks with little to no side effects. On week 4, when the prescription changed to 2 pills in the morning &amp; 2 in the evening, the side effects came on &amp; it didn&#039;t feel right. I chose to lower the dosage on week 5 &amp; only take 2 pills in the morning. Since then, it has been great!  As of 08/01/16, I have lost 25 pounds &amp; feeling great.  I&#039;m glad that I made that change and continued.  I&#039;m very pleased with my outcome with this medicine and I love the ScaleDown program &amp; daily weigh ins.
Started on this med low and slow as I am sensitive to medicine.  Had to increase up and no relief.   Increased 3 times and still no relief.  Did not do much for me but give it a chance.  I took it for over six months.  Many others report excellent results with it
I have dealt with allergies all my life and have tried everything under the sun to stop the agony. This is the only drug that works 100%. It is also one of the cheapest. Highly recommended.
Was on Clonazepam 1 mg as needed. Doctor found out that it causes Alzheimer and dementia so they took me off it. I tried Requip but it made me feel crappy.  When I stood still I felt like I was going to fall, I completely lost my appetite, and other things.
I have been taking this medicine for a three years now. I have tried every antidepressant out there I think. This is the only one that works for me. Along with Abilify and Trazadone this has been a miracle worker for me. I have no side effects. The Trazadone helps with sleep and no nightmares. I wouldn&#039;t be around if it wasn&#039;t for Viibryd.
This medication changed my life. I was diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism years ago and for five years I was on levothyroxine. Despite  taking it every day as recommended, I experienced no difference in my extreme fatigue, muscle aches, and constipation.  I was sleeping all the time. Exercise was a nightmare. No longer the energetic person I used to be. I basically wrote that off as my baseline. Then I started reading about different hypothyroidism treatments and beg my doctor to put me on Naturthroid. I now feel exactly how I am meant to - boundless energy  when I get up in the morning at all throughout the day, and as a result, my mood has dramatically improved.
I was prescribed Bactrim for a UTI. It started to clear it up in a day, but I was so nauseous. I couldn&#039;t even sleep and then I started vomiting on the second day so I went back to the doctor.
My experience with implanon has been off and on good. I got my implant in July 2015 and in September I started losing weight due to diet and exercise. I eventually fell off with that then started gaining weight. So I cannot be sure if its the implant or not? My boobs were constantly sore with the month of October, that has gone away now. I had my period in August, and spotted a little in September but I have not had my period since which the doctor said was normal. I have had a lot of depressed symptoms, I am more sensitive now than I was before. But now I am getting use to it and just becoming more intune with my body. Overall I do like the implant, the procedure did not hurt, everything went well. So far so good for me :)
I had an awful time with Methotrexate side-effects but the disease went into remission and I stopped.  Two years later it was back and this time we tried Humira.  The psoriasis cleared up after about 8 weeks and the arthritis inflammation disappeared.  It&#039;s been about a year today with no side effects other than fatigue at the end of the work day.  I&#039;m 61 and feel I can work another 5 years.  Without Humira I don&#039;t think I could.  Great drug, but too damned expensive.  Bring on the generics.
I started using phentermine on 9/29/2010. I had my first check-up on the 29th of October, and was surprised to see that I had lost an amazing 28 pounds in just 4 short weeks.  The only side effect that I have had is the dry mouth, which I almost consider a good thing because it allows me to drink the water I have always needed to drink.  I have been so tempted to go and buy a scale for the house just to keep up on my weight loss more, but I really like the surprise when I step on that scale at the doctors. This pill is an answer to my prayers and I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about wanting to lose the weight.
I&#039;ve been on Aviane for over a year now and overall like it. I started it to get rid of my acne, I had acne on my face, chest, and back. Aviane cleared up some of my back, and my chest is completely clear but it did not affect my face. On the plus side, I did not gain weight, but I do experience a lot of mood swings. I&#039;ve noticed it is MUCH easier to cry or get upset now. A couple of months ago I started using it to prevent pregnancy as well and for that I haven&#039;t had any problems.
Have had chronic insomnia for 10 years. Had always Ambien. Great drug. Worked great no side effects.Went to a new doctor and he gave me these pills, awful!!!!!! Does not work and feel awful the next day. They should be banned!!!! Haven&#039;t slept a wink in 5 nights now!!!
I love it. I had gotten postpartum depression, it&#039;s helped me enjoy my baby the only side effect I have is takes longer to reach orgasm and little weight gain but not bad. 
My doctor wanted to take me off of Beyaz and I was switched to this; the pill was effective, never spotted. Sometimes period was extremely heavy and other times it barely lasted 3 days. Mood swings were crazy, and my chin has been broken out for the entire 5 months. No matter what I use (soap, acne medication) it will not go away.
I typically take a DHE injection to treat my migraines...the downside is that it takes a couple of hours to rid me of the pain and the symptoms during this cycle are horrible, nausea, nasal congestion, a very drugged, but not sleepy feeling. Treximet is great, it works within 30-minutes to an hour. Does not require sleep or other maintenance.  Downside for me is that within 24 hours, the migraine is back! 
I have been on lolo for 2 years and 4 months. The first year an a half was amazing. I had very light periods, didn&#039;t gain any weight, 0 acne, and no extreme moodswings that I could attribute to the lolo. Unfortunately, about 9 months ago I started getting 2-3 days of spotting in the middle of the month, which wasn&#039;t such a problem.. Unfortunately, the past 2 months the spotting has been more like a full blown heavy period. I&#039;m probably going to take a break from this pill but I&#039;m so so sad because it was so awesome for such a long time.
Love them they take anxiety and the bipolar away and I can finally sleep.
In October of 2015, I am 65, I had a low normal t level of 362 and low libido. My urologist prescribed Axiron, one swipe a day. After a month, it went up, but only to 429. He said I could move the dose up to two swipes a day. One month later, in mid December, my T  level had gone down to 407. After some disappointment, I decided to keep at it for another month. Today, February 9,2016, I got the results of the lab work from last week. It is 407! I did not know why I was getting no results. Am I the only person who has gotten no response from this product?. What could account for this,even at increased dosage? I have heard of a nasal spray, but I don&#039;t know if it is available. Anyone with a like experience or suggestions
I took for 3 yrs, Starts w/tummy ache. Then After 1.5 years I gained 10lbs, had tons of problems with my hair breaking, headaches off and on (never had a headache in my life), moody (unusual for me) chest pains, breast sore and plumper, As soon as I came off it within one week I dropped 5 lbs, now on my fourth week off and have lost 7.5 lbs. I have never had to count calories and had to watch every thing I ate on this med. I always took it out and rinsed it off after sex. I did not get pregnant.  Just a gut feeling I should not use it anymore bc of clots. I had no acne, my sex drive not affected on or off It. My skin glows off it and I feel great
My experience is not specifically about strabismus but general eyesight improvement. I&#039;ve recently had my first round of Botox for wrinkles on the typical areas of forehead and eyes and after three days have noticed an incredible improvement in my reliance on my glasses. I generally have excellent vision but my eyes were constantly strained somehow and I could not function without the glasses. It&#039;s absolutely fantastic and should definitely be further investigated because just for this I am now hooked it is such a relief! Of course I am also extremely pleased about the aesthetic effect too.
I am into my 4th week of Pristiq and it hasn&#039;t yet kicked in.  I still require a clonazepam every morning for the anxiety when I get up.  The wild dreams have finally subsided as have the sweating.  I was on Zoloft for 10 years which worked wonderfully for me until it quit working. I tried Celexa - didn&#039;t work, tried Effexor XR - didn&#039;t work and had a lot of side effects with it.  Pristiq is supposed to be from the same family as Effexor so possibly this may not work.  One can only keep hoping.
My 9 year old son has been taking Intuniv for about a year now and has greatly improved his behavior, mood, impulse control and more. Both myself and his dad suffer from ADHD as well but need Adderall to manage. I was so happy to see a non-stimulant medicine work so well. The only problem we&#039;ve had is excessive weight gain (excess of 30 lbs in 1 year). To the point its very worrisome. Appointment is set to switch to something new.
It worked to help me sleep every time I tried except once. Also is great if you are sick to your stomach. I have never used it for allergies, but I want to. Try it if your Doctor lets you.
Good prenatal vitamin for my pregnancy.
I was on a Depakote, Tegretol and Topiramate cocktail of 12 pills a day. I was not controlled. I even had the VNS implanted in my chest. I switched doctors, and he placed me on Vimpat and Topiramate. Not only am I seizure- free, but I lost 10 lbs. to boot. However, not all good news; hair falling out and tingling in my hands in feet, but I am only on 6 pills a day now.
Only thing and minor, but it burned when being injected.  I was out before I could say anything. Not one side effect!!
Very effective medication, especially if you follow guidelines.  I do notice an effect with my vision on the following days.  It&#039;s as if I have light sensitivity or dry eyes.  I&#039;ve heard of blindness associated with these medicines so anything having to do with my eyes is of concern.
Was only sleeping 2-3 hours a night, some nights none at all. This on top of house, kids and a stressfull job, I was a walking mess. Started taking mirtazapine on my doctor&#039;s advice and it has changed my life completely. No stress and I sleep like a baby.
Very quick, very fast. Great if you are stuck in a tight situation and you are getting breezy.
I am 15 weeks pregnant, and have been fighting hyperemesis since week 10.  I obviously don&#039;t want to take ANY medicines while pregnant, but the risk of not eating and drinking has become much worse.  I&#039;ve had 3 I.V.&#039;s.  I tried Unisom with B6, Zofran, even Phenergan.  Nothing touches the vomiting.  Reglan is the only medicine that will stop the vomiting AND allow me to eat and drink.  I take it only when I&#039;m totally desperate, but it is a miracle.
This stuff is amazing. Not only for acne and acne scars, but for its anti-aging benefits too. I experience moderate hormonal acne breakouts on my chin/jaw area. While Tretinoin doesn&#039;t exactly stop my breakouts completely, it helps control my skin when I do have a breakout. I feel any pimples clear up and heal much quicker and any spotty discolouration that occurs after spots heal disappears much quicker. This stuff has especially done wonders for fine lines around my eyes and between my brows. My skin tone is more even, pores are smaller and condition of my skin/complexion is far nicer. My skin peeled a lot during the first few weeks- use once every few nights until your skin adjusts. I use nightly now with no problems.
This medicine has a built in phlegm breaker and works very well to keep mucus from settling in the chest. Side effects for me is usually sleepiness which is welcome when you are sick.
I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for six weeks so far.  I started at 12.5 mg, advanced to 25 mg and am now at 37.5 mg.  I am increasing to the 50 mg tonight.  It was difficult at first with the side effects of a very sick stomach and increased nervousness.  I see a therapist and she explained to me that my increased nervousness is a result of my anxiety about taking the medicine to begin with!  At this point, I can honestly say I feel a big difference.  I am much more calm, and I feel like my mind is getting some rest.  I used to think WAY too much about everything.  It&#039;s nice.  The side effects are going away.  The sleep isn&#039;t fantastic but I get at least 6.5 hours so I&#039;ll take it. Overall, I&#039;m very happy and looking forward to whats to come.
For me, it clears up outbreaks within 7 days and is used as a control when the fungus tries to make a comeback.  The only drawback I have experienced is to my wallet.  Very expensive even after insurance.
Vivid nightmares have been greatly reduced.
My son is almost 4 he is autistic and his violent rage got completely out of control his pediatrician perscribed Risperidone for him about a week ago and so far the results have been mind blowing. He is on 1mL once daily he has had minimal side effects (tremors, fatigue) however the aggression, outbursts, meltdowns and violence has ceased completely. He is also non-verbal and I do not know if this medicine is a contributing factor but in the last week alone my son has started repeating words and even sang his ABC&#039;s out of no where. This has been a God send for us!
Excellent pain reliever for chronic headaches after brain tumor removal.  No high like Vicodin and relief lasts longer with no bounce back pain.
Efficacy never in doubt with this fast acting benzodiazapine. Alprazolam works on the neuro-transmitter GABA to induce calming effects. It is useful to many patients who try it and is preferred over similar medications because of its relative safety. Regardless of how it is used, it is very potent and may be habit forming. A typical dose for a recreational user or someone addicted to this drug may be many times what would be considered safe. If taking Xanax more than 4 mg per day then slowly taper.
I started using the generic brand which the pharmacy gave me and had really bad side effects, such as feeling depressed, listless, crying all the time which I never do, then my doctor recommended I use the name brand Alesse. I&#039;ve been on it a month with no side effects at all. I feel great. I had no cramping and a lighter period. I feel happy and myself again. I&#039;ve tried a lot of other brands all with some side effects. For me this is a great birth control.
My daughter, 11 yo, was prescribed Tamiflu for influenza A. She took it for a day, it helped to break the fever but at a high cost of the worst nausea in her life. We decided to discontinue taking it as side effects are worse than flu symptoms on their own. Please be cautious of severe nausea if you decide to take Tamiflu.
It helped me a lot. One pill and I sleep like a baby.
This pill is great in theory... Unless you take it on the first day of your period like instructed! Week 3 of this pill, and week 3 of my period. I&#039;m pretty disappointed. And the mood swings I&#039;ve been experiencing are ridiculous! Bright side, I haven&#039;t had any cramping. That&#039;s the only good thing I have to say about this pill right now.
I experienced severe leg cramps almost immediately upon taking this medication and whatever else it may have been doing for me. I could not tolerate the cramps which even interfered with my ability to sleep, walk, drive or climb stairs.
I have been taking 120mg of Cymbalta, daily, since it was first introduced &amp; I couldn&#039;t be more satisfied with its results. I was diagnosed with severe, clinical, depression, approximately 15 years ago &amp; all antidepressants prescribed to me, prior to Cymbalta, worked for a year, before they completely stopped working for me. I&#039;ve tried every SSRI available &amp; the same thing would happen, every time, UNTIL Cymbalta became available. I have no negative side effects, never have, &amp; Im so very grateful for them.
I have spent a long time trying to find the right cocktail of meds since I was diagnosed with BPD, Bipolar, Depression and anxiety. Currently I&#039;m taking 100mg of Lamactal, 50mg Cymbalta and 50mg of Trazadone. I feel awesome! I&#039;m not as moody, I&#039;m happy. It&#039;s a shame that I have to switch medications because I LOVE my mood, however the sexual side effects are just something I cant take. My NP is putting me on Viiebyd instead of the Cymbalta and from reading the reviews, I&#039;m nervous about it. If the new medication dosnt work for me, I will go back to the cocktail I was taking and figure something out with the sexual side effects
My first birth control was the patch which I liked, no side effects. It was a pain though cause it would always fall off, so I decided to get the shot. My first shot I got extremely emotional. But that didnt last long. Eventually my period went away and I didnt experience any side effects. I chose to get off of it because I wanted to have a baby and I got pregnant seriously like a couple weeks after I stopped it. While I was breastfeeding I got on the pill but switched back to the shot. I spotted and bled more when I got the shot after I had the baby but it wasnt to bad. It might have contributed to me gaining 5 or more lbs but im not to sure. Overall i love this birth control!
Earlier this year I broke out terribly with trying every remedy known to man.  Then I started taking doxycycline 100mg 1-2 times per day (please take with food or after eating). Within days I saw a difference...my acne started to dry up. In a nutshell doxycycline saved my face and esteem...highly recommend it.
I began Junel FE 1/20 five days ago and I&#039;ll update this after a couple months of having been on this pill. I&#039;m using it for birth control as well as period regulation. I got my period on a Saturday and began taking it the day after. My period was extremely heavy for the first day because I&#039;d taken Plan B earlier in the month but immediately after beginning the birth control my period was actually lighter than usual. I&#039;ve never had great skin, and I&#039;ve noticed some increased acne since starting the pill, as well as some depression. I&#039;m going to give my body some time to let my hormone levels balance before I really judge this pill, but those are the effects I&#039;ve seen immediately after beginning it.
Like most people, I was extremely nervous about the procedure to get this birth control inserted. However, I was so done having to take an oral contraceptive everyday and just wanted something that was less of a hassle. After discussing different options with my OBGYN, we decided on NEXPLANON. It only took a week from talking with my doctor before the actual procedure. I had watched multiple youtube videos on the process and was extremely nervous. My doctor did an excellent job talking me through everything he did and I honestly didn&#039;t feel a thing. It was so quick and easy! I didn&#039;t have any bruising or side effects after the insertion. Its been a little over a month and nothing! Its awesome.
I am 35 &amp; have suffered from an overactive bladder &amp; urethral inflammation for 19 years, voiding close to 20x during the night, &amp; sometimes over 50x during a flare. I was prescribed medication for I.C  for years, even though I insisted it was OAB. I took Amitriptyline that helped me sleep, but nothing that settled my bladder during the day, until I found mirabegron.  Immediately the symptoms stopped and didn&#039;t have to void for over 3 hours, absolute heaven! I feel normal! My advice, don&#039;t let anyone misdiagnose you, research your symptoms and try process of elimination until you find something that works. Make sure you read what counteracts with this med, as it could cause side effects, eg alcohol and flu tablets 4 me, that increased frequency.
I was given the three month injection in July 2012, with no mention of the potential side effects. I have been off lupron for over one year and still have debilitating bone/joint and muscle pain. I have had significant hair loss, short term memory problems and depression. My physical disabilities mean I will probably have to give up work. It is disgraceful that this drug was given to me with no discussion around these life changing side effects. I&#039;m worse now than before I started!!
I have Chronic Lyme disease which has caused chronic pain.  The Drs have tried just everything but nothing seems to help.  I was on 125mcgs of Fentanyl with 32mgs of Dilaudid and still in full blown pain 24/7.  I was detoxed off the Fentanyl with Suboxone (not a pleasant experience) and the hope was the Suboxone would address my pain but it didn&#039;t.  The Dr. seemed to think the BuTrans patch 20mg might help so I started on it six days ago.  I don&#039;t feel a huge difference pain wise but I have had non stop headaches and a total lack of motivation to do even the smallest of tasks.  I really don&#039;t know if i should continue on it, whether the headaches will slowly subside or if I should tear the patch off so I don&#039;t have to go through withdrawal?
I have taken Lasix for a week to reduce the swelling in my legs.  It&#039;s working fine and I feel better.  The side effects are manageable.  I have to pee a lot, and I&#039;ve had to deal with some headaches.
I am a female in my late 60s, and on day 13 of the 1st round of 14.  After tomorrow, I will be off 2 weeks, and back on for 2 weeks.  I am using it on my temples and forehead.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair to cover the red spots that have surfaced on my temples.  However, I have had NO flu like symptoms, NO fatigue, NO stomach problems. Nothing.....just a bunch of ugly red spots
I first tried Bontril about 7 years ago when I went to a weight loss center. I lost 47 pounds and kept if off for about three years. I remember taking two pills 30 minutes before each meal. 354mg tabs and I was told not to take my last dose after 4pm due to it will keep you from sleeping. I also followed a high protein diet. I was like 190 pounds then and I think I got down to 147. but over the years I&#039;ve gained weight, had a baby and gained more weight. I&#039;m now 235 pounds and started taking bontril a week ago and I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds in a week, I was told to take 1 pill a hour before meals, I&#039;ve increased to 2 pills before breakfast and 2 before lunch and 1 in the evening and I have no appetite I have to make myself eat. I hope this continue
I love it! I&#039;m too forgetful for the pill. I actually all together stopped getting my period. I had a regular period prior to getting it, but due to my daily medication, the side effect was no period. I do still get the mild cramps, aches and pains....but I really can&#039;t Complain. Downside....I&#039;ve gained 35 pounds. I&#039;ve had it for 3 years in Dec. Other than that it is wonderful!!!!!!!
I have several issues and was given Remeron along with Seroquel and Tegretol, I take it at night and I sleep now, its pretty amazing but I&#039;m so tired after taking it that I can&#039;t keep my eyes open no matter what. In the 3 weeks I have been on it I have gained 3lbs which is awesome for me. I hope the sleepiness dies down some as it is a bit strong for me, but overall this is a great medicine.
So I have always been a big girl! I have 3 kids and with each pregnancy there was added weight that just carried over and you know how the story goes...I pushed myself and my wants and needs to the side and took care of everyone but myself. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got. I got to 280lbs!!!! My body was in constant pain and discomfort and I knew I had to stop and do do something about it. I started the pills last year and lost a total of 125lbs!!! Not just the pills but I started the gym, did zumba 3 times a week and started eating good. The pills aren&#039;t the magic fix. They just help you kind of like a kick start. Sure I had side effects!!!! But nothing that would out weight being close to 300lbs.
My OBGYN just prescribed this medication based on 15% unexplained weight gain over the past 2 years due to peri-menopausal symptoms. I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot; and weigh 140-145lbs. I have always maintained this weight even between and after both pregnancies. My youngest is now 5 years old and I&#039;m suddenly up to 168. I took my first dose on Tuesday (4/24) at 12:30pm. My doc warned me that if I may feel jittery (crawling out of my skin feeling) over the first few days. I&#039;m happy to report that I have had NO such ill side effect and sleeping better than before. As of this morning (4/27 Day 3) I am 165lbs. It is the best feeling I&#039;ve had in months! Make that years! It&#039;s the boost in confidence that I&#039;ve been so desperately seeking! Two thumbs up so far!
I took Mirena for 3 years and switch today to paraguard instead. Insertion wasn&#039;t too painful and hurt much less than the IUD I have now. The removal was actually hurt more) Anyways, the first year I had irregular periods, but no weight gain, no moodiness, no pain during sec, or lack of sex drive-  so that was great. The reason I chose to remove it, is that the last 6 months or so, I had much more spotting, I thought my periods would go away, but they never did, and it became highly unpredictable. I am hoping that if I have to have a period, I&#039;d like to know when it is, even if it&#039;s heavier. I am now going to give the Paraguard a try and see how it goes, if the side effects are worse than Mirena, I will likely be switch back.
Pros: Works well keeping me alert, no significant downer when drug wears off, can be used on an as needed basis. Cons: EXPENSIVE!
After holding on to the medication for about 3 weeks I couldn&#039;t believe the results after just one day and literally felt the effects hours after I took the medication. I did experience side effects far as the nausea, diarrhea, headache and dizziness but I found out after taking it the second day that it was only because I hadn&#039;t eaten before Celexa. I really see the difference I&#039;m no longer stressed and depressed I do feel the difference and it&#039;s a really great medication. I was so iffy about taking depression anxiety medication however I&#039;m so glad that I did.
I took plan B within a few hours of a condom breaking. No side effects at all. Not even the slightest cramping. I did go poo 4 times in the first 3 hours after taking it which is unusual for me but may have been a coincidence.
This has a been a wonder drug for me.  I have been taking it along with a low dose of Wellbutrin for 3 weeks and I don&#039;t think I have ever felt better in my life. I noticed an improvement within a few days. No problems sleeping.
I was on this birth control for over 4 years. I had to stop in October because I changed health insurance so I decided to let my body have a little rest before going on a new one. It has been 6 months and I have not gotten a period since stopping the birth control. Before I went on it I had regular monthly cycles, but this birth control messed everything up. Also, about 3 years into taking the pills I started to develop scarring cystic acne that hasn&#039;t gone away even after stopping. This birth control clearly did something to my hormones that I am hoping could be reversed. The only reason why I am giving it any stars is because while I was on it I didn&#039;t have any side effects and periods were super light (when I got them)
Consistently effective to prevent daytime onset of cluster headache if taken between 5-6AM if prodromal. Works for approximately 22 hours at 2.5 mg single dose. Cost of 1 pill is now prohibitive at more than $50. Generic naratriptan 2.5 mg as Naratrex can be purchased overseas for 53 cents!
I&#039;ve been on painkillers for a week and a half including codeine and tramadol, so I&#039;ve been really backed up which led to more pain. I&#039;ve been suffering with a severe kidney infection and a burst ovarian cyst. I took two tablets at 9pm woke up at 2:30 with cramping quite severe but to be honest nothing worse that the pain I&#039;ve been in with my problems anyways. Feels great to have a  BM yeah it&#039;s pure liquid but that&#039;s what a laxative does. I would recommend if it&#039;s severe constipation you have especially the type codiene gives you!
This pill works really well. Not for everyone but those that it will work on, it works great. Take effect in about 2 to 3 weeks.
I experienced light headiness to the point of nausea for a few minutes after dosage. Symptoms dissappear quickly.
I started Paxil in 2000, I was depressed, I stopped drinking vodka, no desire.. I was not cured instantly but have never wanted a &#039;drink&#039; since April 2000. I recently started talk therapy, and have been satisfied thus far. It is really letting all the wires connect better. Life will always be a challenge..BEST...January 2010.
I got my Kyleena IUD inserted about 4 months ago. I heard very mixed experiences on whether or not insertion hurt - and for me it was extremely painful. I had pretty bad cramping and had to avoid exercise for about 3-4 days after insertion, which wasn&#039;t too bad. For the past 2 months I have been experiencing the worst cramps EVER that come at very random times. I have never given birth before, but I often think that these cramps must be what contractions feel like. I&#039;ve had ultrasounds and I have been told that the IUD has not shifted or anything, so the cause of the cramps is unknown. I&#039;m hoping they go away because I don&#039;t know how long I can take it!!
I switched from Pristiq which was keeping me up at night. My initial dose was 50 mg. it was hell the first week: crying spells panick attacks but my doc promised it will improve. After I bumped it up to 100 mg the hell got worse; panick attacks&amp; anxiety were unbearable but I kept telling myself to stick with it. So, I did until the end of week 2 on higher dose when I was hospitalized with seizures due to serotonin syndrome. Still taking Ativan 1 mg every 5-6 hours for seizures. Not a good experience.
This is my 5th day on 20 mg (lowest dose - 1 pill per day) Cymbalta for fibromyalgia.  The first 3 days were tough.  My pain would subside during the day, but return almost fully at night. I did not sleep for the first three nights on this medicine. I was also very jittery beginning on day 2. By day 4 most of these side effects subsided and I&#039;ve been pain free for 48 hours now. I was prescribed 5mg of Ambien to help with the sleep issue. I feel great and energetic for the first time in months. I am thrilled that the lowest dose worked for me.
The 45 minute infusion was a piece of cake.Take my calcium and vitamin D faithfully as you need it for the reclast to work. No side effects,no pain. 
Within just a few days I began to feel so much better.  Highly recommended
Believe it or not, I&#039;ve been on Doxycycline for just about 1.5 years now. I really didnt have any serious acne as a teen but once I turned 25 for some reason it blew up! I tried everything but everything only seemed to make it angry lol so on doxycycline I went. It is like a miracle for me as far as effectiveness it clears my skin 100%. So why didn&#039;t I give a 10 on the review? Because I&#039;ve attempted to stop taking it a few times and it only takes about 2-3 days for my acne to return with a vengeance!  My body breaks out like crazy so bad if I don&#039;t take it. It definitely makes you pay if you stop taking it lol
I tried this new medicine from my Doctor&#039;s sample.  290 once a day.  It worked the first time within one hour from swallowing.  I usually have a movement once a week, I had fourteen movements that one day, unfortunately they became all water after the first couple.  I took the following couple days off to get rehydrated and then tried it again, I think I am on my tenth movement in three hours from taking. The pill did take away my pain and cramps but I had to cancel my plans for the day but it is well worth not having the pain and cramps of constipation.
18 years old and dealing with my second YI. The first time I went straight to Monostat 3 and it worked great without any pain. This time I went for the generic expecting the same experience and boy was I wrong. This is the first night and 5 minutes after hopping into bed the burning began. When it didn&#039;t stop after 10 minutes I jumped to google and found this page. I&#039;m glad to know I&#039;m not the only one with this issue but VERY angry they didn&#039;t say this could happen on the box! A nice &quot;if you&#039;re willing to go through fire to get rid of your YI, then this is for you&quot; would have sufficed. I&#039;m wondering if it has something to do with the product being generic? Has anybody else encountered this?
The first year I thought it was a miracle birth control options, no period, no cramps, no real side effects. Into the third year I have uncontrollably weight gain despite exercise and diet, deep facial acne, migraines that I never had before the neiplanon, I feel full and bloated all the time, acid reflux daily, and stomach pains. I decided I wanted it out over a month ago so I made an appointment with my doctor two months out, my doc cancelled and scheduled it another month out..... I want the thing out of my arm NOW, but urgent care and the ER will not touch it because they say a nurse with special training must remove it or it&#039;s a liability... So now I either wait and hope my doc doesn&#039;t cancel. DON&#039;T GET NEXIPLANON!
As a birth control - I was on this for over 6 years with no problems. Now I&#039;m back on to control my moods after 2 births. Trying to get my hormones back in check. And I&#039;m not too happy. I feel like I have no energy and no libido. Both of which could be due to the kids. However, my mood swings are back in check. I have gained a significant amount of weight in the year I&#039;ve been back on it (6lbs) despite no changes in diet or exercise. So overall it&#039;s doing what it should. But I wish I was me again. Hopefully that will come. My husband is really sick of the no libido thing though.
I feel more energetic and can focus more the first 2 weeks of injection.
I was told that I have rheumatoid arthritis a few months back.  I have been on Plaquenil now for almost 2 months.  It has helped with the pain in my hands and feet.  I still have swollen fingers but am waiting for the full affects of the drug.  I do not know how common this is but the side effect that I am having is hair loss.  I am guessing it wouldn&#039;t be as bad if I was a male but being a female.  I am hoping this stops after my body gets used to the medicine because I am very discouraged with that aspect.
I&#039;m 17 and have been using the Ortho Evra Patch for about 2 years now, I absolutely love it!! It helped out my periods a lot! Before I was on the Nuvaring and I hated it compared to the patch! It&#039;s so easy to remember and easy to apply! It just looks like a nude color band aid, I just apply it to my butt cheek so no one can see it. The first few weeks I had some problems, but after I&#039;ve never had another problem with it! I highly suggest it! And it definitely prevents pregnancy!
First time to take ropinirole for rls. Took 1 2mg  table at 9.45 pm. 30 minutes later I naused,a cold sweat, dizzy, and disoriented. Thought I need to go to ER. I vomoited a couple of times and felt better in about one hour. Will not use again.
I have been taking Lexapro for 5 months now and it has really worked for me.  I am a 30 year old working mother of two and got very depressed due to alot of factors which included balancing work and family and trying hard to make ends meet.  I cried alot and suffered terribly from tension headaches.  Since starting Lexapro I have been much better with the kids and better able to cope with what life throws at me.  The only side effects I have noticed is a little weight gain and lack of sex drive (which doesn&#039;t make my husband too happy) but he will get over it.
I have had this over a year now.  It is truly great so far!  Nothing but a spot or two once a month and no cramps!  Hey,  I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant either,  so it must be working!  I found the FEAR of insertion was much worse than the actual insertion.  Now I feel my arm every once in a while and check on my little friend.
Well I went to the ER, they diagnosed me with gout. They gave me a prescription that was $45 for 20 pills! Pharmacist told about Aleve. I bought it for $7.99/100 pills. Best choice ever, no regrets
Suboxone was great for my opiate dependence. I was using 160 mg oxy daily and really wanted to be free from its painful grip that it had on me. I tried quitting cold turkey but couldn&#039;t stand the withdrawal symptoms. So I went to a doctor and got on Suboxone. Things were great until I started tapering off of it and eventually quit. The withdrawal was not as painful as opiate withdrawal but lasted a lot longer. Day 3 was when it began mostly when trying to sleep, cold sweats, the kicks, could not sleep at all. Day 7 now and I have not slept more than 2 hours a night yet. I have read posts on other sites and everyone else has had the same problems. I hear day 10 is when it starts to get better, and that it takes about 2 weeks before its over.
I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in March 2008 and immediately put on Lyrica.  I went up to 100mg and over the course of 6 months, gained 40 lbs.  I tried natural remedies with no help so I went back on the Lyrica.  I was blessed to be a part of a Fibromyalgia group at University of Michigan and got to meet and be examined by the head of their Neurology department who advised me to try Cymbalta.  He sent a detailed report to my doctor and I began on 30mg at night.  That was 4 months ago.  I have my life back- without the crazy eating binges!  I just recently had to bump up to 60mg daily. What a great drug!  I had mild itching the first two nights, but now I don&#039;t experience any of the side effects.  The only problem is losing weight.
I was told to take this medication with food, which I did.  Within an hour I had overwhelming nausea and diarrhea and then vomiting for several hours after that. 
This pill is awesome. I&#039;ve taken it for about 2 and 1/2 years now. No side effects when I first started either. I haven&#039;t had a period since but I&#039;m okay with that. I highly recommend this pill to anyone looking for a low dose birth control.
I&#039;ve been on it for over a year &amp; it does work against pregnancy but gives me overwhelming nausea every single day &amp; doesn&#039;t go away it also fixed my period but gave me cramps
It did not even step up to the plate. My wife said it tastes terrible.
I was addicted to any type of pill I could possibly find, from oxycodone to roxy and everything in between. My addiction ruined everything that I held precious to me and it lasted from the time I was 16 till I was 20. I withdrew cold turkey for a week and then finally got put on Suboxone. I was taking 3 8mg strip a day for 2 years. I have finally been off of it for almost a year now. The hardest part was coming off the Suboxone it took me about 6 to 8 months to completely come off of it. And slowly but surely I am now going to be 3 years sober. Suboxone saved my life and gave me everything back that I have ever wanted and more. I would recommend this medicine to anyone who is having problems with addiction. It was truly a God send.
I was depressed for 2 months while on this pill. As soon as I stopped taking it my depression went away. I have a prescription for Naturethroid and I really hope it works!
I was on Effexor for over 10 yrs. I finally got off this in Dec. 2013 and as of today, July 2015, I&#039;m still having those brain zips several times a day. Last July, I started with a vibration and severe pain in my feet. It&#039;s all nerve connected and I think it&#039;s from long term use of Effexor. This medication works great for depression but the side effects are not worth it.
I&#039;ve been on Trintellix 20 mg x 10 months, 53-year-old female with long-standing, chronic MDD &amp; anxiety since pre-teen years.  Been on far too many antidepressants over the decades to list them all here.  Been hospitalized a number of times &amp; in my 30&#039;s, resorted to ECT as a last resort, which did absolutely nothing. My psychiatrist says my MDD is very treatment-resistant.  Antidepressants, even in high doses, or combined, have no effect.  But I do believe for once in my life, the Trintellix is making some difference for the better in me; hasn&#039;t been a &quot;miracle&quot; drug, but it does help!  No nausea or side effects, either! Also on Xanax, trazodone for sleep, &amp; 10 mg Adderall daily.
I just started taking the pill almost two months now and aside from certain downsides I like it. My periods are so little its basically only spotting and I no longer have any cramps, which I am thankful for because prior I could barely move in peace with them. Only things that are deeply disturbing is the weight gain that I gained in such a small period of time also my breasts have become increasingly sore at all times of the day. I have mood swings every now and again and in the beginning I would get depressed very quickly but that didn&#039;t last long. Hope it works for you
Just started this medicine today for c diff, which I have been trying to fight with diet &amp; probiotics for months now.  I thought I had a handle on it at first, but the bugs clearly had a meeting in my gut about their dwindling numbers and decided to multiply faster than ever before. It returned with a vengeance. Reading all of these horrid side effects is scary but a ten day ride through mall of it seems appealing to me at this point if it kills the c diff. No metallic taste for me so far but I do feel sort of loopy and may just go to bed for a week. Will update my progress and experiences soon. Insomnia? God I hope not.
I have been taking Phenergan 25mg for yrs now. I have no problem with it and it works fine for me. This is for the lady that said she was 65yr old and her daughter had same reaction. You are severely allergic to Phenergan, do not take it any more, please. My wife was prescribed it for nausea and vomiting. She started taking it and every time she started feeling like throwing up by the time I made her go to the emergency room she was on the couch with her feet raised, I mean I had to put a cinder block under the end of the couch to raise it up enough for her. She could not stand up without throwing up and I had to hold her up to get to the bathroom. She was in the hospital for a week. Now she cannot look up without getting dizzy &amp; going to pass out!
I used the Monistat 7 day and this by far is the worse treatment I&#039;ve ever used. I never felt so much discomfort in my life and burns like hell. Gyne Lotrimin by far was the best treatment ever guess that&#039;s why they disconitued it
I&#039;ve been taking omeprazole for quite a time prior to being prescribed Plavix but NONE of the health professionals involved in my treatment have advised me to cease the Omeprazole even though it&#039;s regarded as unwise to. This worries me and I have ceased of my own accord until I can access my GP!
Worst experience ever. Got diarrhea and started vomiting. I suggest eat a light meal before taking this . I really hope it cleared my infection  since I did vomit....I don&#039;t want to do it all over again
So far I am extremely impressed! After beginning birth control on Reclipsen (the worst pill in the world) I began Gildess because my friend used it and claimed she actually lost weight! So I gave it a try. Weight loss did in fact occur. The junk food cravings that I had accumulated because of Reclipsen subsided quickly and my appetite has gone way down. I only get hungry about once a day. My severe cystic back acne is gone. GONE. It just vanished with this pill. My face cleared up a little as well and the overall texture of my skin is improved. Softer, smaller pores, clearer. NOW THE CONS: Nausea for the first 3 weeks. spotting for the first month. I&#039;m a little more emotional but it&#039;s controllable. I really do recommend this pill.
I now have been on this medication for 7 months, I have lost 40 Pounds and no longer have to take cholesterol lowering medicine. I sleep better, have NO hot flashes and feel I have my new lease on life. I&#039;m wearing skinny jeans! The only side effect has been some increased thirst. I drink more water, not a bad thing either. 
My doctor offered me Contrave, and I started taking it on Nov. 10, 2015,  I weighed 175 ibs but I am only 5 ft tall and small boned.  So I really need to get down to at least 115-120 at the most.   I have been on it for three weeks now and so far I&#039;ve lost 11 lbs.  and I am on a low carb diet.  I feel better, and my appetite is deminishing, some of the side effects I noticed is dry mouth, constipation, a slight headache but I believe it will go away, it is tolerable.  I have tried so many things in the past and never could really stick to anything, the doctor said my cholesterol is high and so I am doing everything I can right now eating wise to get it to come down, I am going to give myself 6mths on this diet and scale down program.
I have been type 1 diabetic for 28 years diagnosed at 12 years old, have been on insulin 28 years, 6 years on a pump.  I joined a research study in Nov. 2014, to test Invokana on type 1 diabetics to see if it could help type 1&#039;s.  I am so amazed and happy with this medication!  I have cut down on my insulin a lot, only 9 units of basal for the day!  I lost 6 pounds.  I feel and look great lots more energy.  Yes there is a genital itch problem, I also had hives, which I believe it worth it for great blood sugars and weight loss.  Lucky I am born and raised in Canada where our health insurance covers the cost completely.
I have been prescribed several maintenance medications to control my COPD over the past 4  years. Ventolin has proved to be, by far, the best medication I have used. Very quick acting &amp; reassuring.
My HbAC1 was at 8.5 and I tried many medicine for 4 years and without great success.   I started using Victoza 7 weeks ago.   First 2 weeks, I used 0.6mg and it did not do much for me, hardly noticed the difference.    I increased to 1.2mg the following week.   I try to remember, but I did not remember much side effect.   I did have bruising at the injection site about 4 times, if you even call that side effect.   The morning blood sugar came normal around 7.2.   I lost only 2 kilograms(4 lb) for the fist 30 days.    On the fifth week, I went to 1.8mg.   Now I really start to feel there is no appetite.   I eat every 2 hours for some fruit or other little snacks.   Now, I do have trouble sleeping, but I can live with that.   a total 9lb now
I have developed a severe allergy problem this year. I&#039;ve been put on several different antihistamines and Astelin is by far the most effective. Since it is a nasal spray it&#039;s instant relief! I&#039;m so glad my doctor put me on this. I can finally breathe again. If you have problems with congestion from allergies I would strongly recommend talking to your doctor about Astelin.
I had foot surgery 10 days ago.  For pain these seem to work well.  However the basic side effects are more than I want to deal with: dizzy, weak, nausea, short of breath.
Before I took this I was suffering from constipation and diarrhea.  The drug helps settle my stomach, I take it twice a day.  The pills are very small and disintegrate fast with liquid, which make them extremely easy to swallow.  I use to dread using the bathroom before I started taking this drug.  Now I don&#039;t even think twice about it and my stress level has decreased dramatically.
I&#039;ve had the Implanon in since October 07 - brilliant. For the first 6 months I had bleeding/spotting. For the second 6 months, I got my period for 2-3 days every 2-3 weeks. However since January 09, no period at all (whoppee!). I actually lost 4-5 pounds after getting it in due to the constant bleeding. My libido has fluctuated a bit every now and then (very very high just after I got it put in, and somewhat lower at the moment).  I have several friends who also got it inserted: 3 had similar experiences to me, another had it removed due to anxiety/ depression (but bear in mind she was only 16 at the time which I think would be a bit young to get it!), and another had it removed due to bad acne. Everybody&#039;s different, it&#039;s worked for me though.
This is the first medicine I&#039;ve taken that doesn&#039;t make me feel medicated.
I am almost 46 and for 30 years have tried everything for chronic hormonal acne (antibiotics, Accutane, all the skin care lines, Retin A).  This medication has been a miracle for me.  I still get little blackheads / small pimples around my menses, but are barely noticeable. I continue on with my Retin A treatment which helps that. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects.  I do watch my potassium intake (no bananas).
I take Cymbalta for both dysthymia and fibromyalgia.  I am a female in my mid-40&#039;s.  Overall, I am at least 70% better than before taking Cymbalta, though not pain-free.  I find that I get maximum benefit when I take 120 mg (two 60 mg. capsules at same time) of Cymbalta daily, combined with enough sleep and daily exercise (e.g. at least 20 mins. brisk walking).  Also, I need to avoid/minimize physical and psychological stressors (including unpleasant people).
I had the Mirena IUD placed 4 weeks ago. I had heard that the initial placement can be very painful, however, I only felt a very slight ache/pressure when my doc put it in. He even had to manually expand my cervix because it wouldn&#039;t open for him at all. But even with that, it wasn&#039;t bad. I did bleed quite a bit after insertion because he had to pry everything open basically lol. But really not a bad experience. I rated it at an 8 because I&#039;ve been bleeding since about day 5 post insertion. It varies from light spotting to full blown period heaviness from day to day (cramps too) and hasn&#039;t stopped for 3 weeks. Its quite a mood killer :/ but I&#039;d still choose this over the pill, honestly. The bleeding is the only downside for me.
I was taken off of Yaz and put onto this because it was causing me migraines with aura.  I have been on it for a couple years now I&#039;d say.  I never really noticed it until my boyfriend mentioned to me how I never am &quot;in the mood&quot; anymore.  We used to have a very steady sex life together and now maybe 1 time a month.  I went to the doctor a while ago and she ran blood tests on me and they came back that my iron is severely low.  I&#039;ve never had that before until I started taking this pill.  I also seem to get angry very and upset easily. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s the pills fault but I was never like that before I started taking it.  I started getting regular headaches again, so my Doctor switched me to a different brand that I have yet to try.
I have been using Zyrtec for more than 15 years. It perfectly helped me get rid of my chronic idiopathic urticaria. When I don&#039;t take the pill, the next day, itching starts. Also, I can&#039;t sleep well in case I forget to take my pill at night.
I have only used this for two and a half days and it&#039;s already brought down ALL the redness that made it look terrible and they are going down incredibly. I strongly suggest this. I am 13 almost 14 and it does work. I love this! 
My experience with this BC started out well but quickly took a horrible turn. I had been on it a few years ago and experienced moods swings so I stopped taking it. I started again about 3 months ago. While I had no period, crapping, or acne..it caused me to be more anxious than I ever had been. I have barely slept in days, I feel extremely depressed and have a negative outlook on life. This BC ruined me, nausea, leg pain, anxiety and depression. Please be careful if you have a history of anxiety or depression taking this. The mood swings just aren&#039;t worth it. Losing my sex drive and have been pulling away from my boyfriend. I would definitely not recommend this BC to anyone, even someone I hated lol.
Was on 10 day 2x a day regime. Felt better, fever broke after 2 days, but cough never went away. About a week after finishing my symptoms came back full force and worse. Had to go back to the Dr and got a z pack, prednisone, and an inhaler. I&#039;ve been sick for 3 weeks. This drug didn&#039;t get rid of my infection and I was very disappointed. Hoping the z pack works.
I&#039;ve been on this medication for 8 months now. I am anemic and the bleeding was fine at first. It was my normal heavy flow. I went on vacation and planned on starting while I was gone. However, I didn&#039;t. When I got my period I bled HEAVILY for about 4 wks. A tampon every hour and a half. The last day, I had a blood clot the size of my palm.Then the next four days was very very light bleeding. And then back to the heavy flow of numerous clots. It&#039;s been almost 2 months now. I&#039;ve been put on a birth control. Hoping this will help. But I&#039;m definitely changing it soon. It has made my depression and anxiety so much worse. NOT WORTH IT.
I am on my 6th week.  My pharmacy changed me from Gildess and before it was Junel.   I saw my PCP yesterday and was in tears (which is also strange that I can cry on a dime) and feared that my RA meds are killing my stomach and I was going to have to stop treatment due to the side effects.  I have tried 2 different RA meds and continued to get sick.  My PCP asked me about my BCP&#039;s and if there were any changes.  A light went off. YES! I am on my 6th week now.  My hormones are wacked, I am irritable, and my stomach is in knots every day.  I have been taking nausea medication almost daily.  My system is a mess between not being able to go to the restroom or going too much.  I am calling my mail order pharmacy and my GYN.  I must change RX.
Aside from all of the stomach issues and fatigue, this is now the second time that a box of the pens have been defective.  When you contact the company to report it, they all but call you a liar.  I will be telling my doctor to find another med.  I use other pens and have never had a problem with them.  The secondary issue is now I have used pens ahead of time in the place of defective ones and my insurance will not authorize more pens ahead of time.  The drug company did agree to do a &quot;&quot;&quot;one&quot;&quot;&quot; time replacement of the two pens.  Getting off now because this tells me I am on my own in the future.
I&#039;ve had 2 children so the insertion could be described as a mild contraction feeling. Got through it. Take pain mess before and after insertion and plan to take a few days off. Bad cramps and spotting for about 6 weeks but then I&#039;ve not even had a period now and it&#039;s been almost 6 months. So happy with it and acne a bit more but no horrible side effects and it&#039;s been wonderful to know I&#039;m not going to get pregnant unplanned again. Takes the worry away and no periods really rocks!
For me it didn&#039;t work. I was always spotting and bleeding and having to wear protection for that everyday.
I was put on 50mg daily, but didn&#039;t notice any change so I was increased to 100mg to deal with depression. It was horrendous and the first 6 weeks I suffered terrible nightmares and night sweats, became even more irate, anxious and upset and had suicidal thoughts. All advice outlets told me to continue for three months to see how I felt, only to find after 6 weeks I felt numb and emotionless, getting no pleasure or satisfaction from daily activities. This was not the medication for me and essentially made me feel worse.
Love love love this drug. It has normalized my sleep, though the initial morning grogginess was hard to deal with. However, this side effect went away after the first month or two. I&#039;m at 300mg and it has normalized my moods and has mostly gotten rid of my anxiety. The only downside is that it causes some pretty extreme &quot;munchies,&quot; which does lead to some weight gain. May also have contributed to my pre-diabetic condition.
I was taking bio identical hormones. The doctor insisted I take arimidex with the pellets. Omg I was strong, healthy and never had joint pain. I can barely do yoga, my hip joints and knees hurt. I am cancer free but this doctor wouldn&#039;t give me the hormones without the Arimidex. As soon as I got the injection I knew it was th arimidex that was causing th pain. 4 months later I was getting my hormone injections again. I told her I WOULD NOT take the arimidex. She made me sign a release saying she wasn&#039;t responsible. Of course I did. But she didn&#039;t sign anything saying she caused this terrible pain.
Okay, so the insertion of this thing sucked, and the 1-2 months following also sucked. It was painful, I basically had a period for a month, and would have very regular spotting. My sex life was a little off as a result, but my husband was ok with that. 6 months later it was all worth it. Almost no period at this point, still cramp during that time - but nothing that can&#039;t be managed. My moods are balanced and I&#039;m so happy I did it. Everyone&#039;s experience is different, but I highly recommend Skyla is you have heavy periods. This did exactly what I needed it to, and my husband is pretty happy about not having to worry about condoms anymore. It&#039;s makes &quot;being in the moment&quot; a lot more fun :)
Most subtle of the benzos i have tried.  Made me sleepy the first hour or two, but then stabilized anxiety and mood for about 6 hours.  Much longer lasting than it is given credit for.  Good PRN medication.  Other benzos cause some moodiness or depression even.  Although I think Lorazepam can, it is much smoother than others.  It again is too sedating for many people though.  I liked it about as good as Clonazepam, it is better than Valium IMO.
Hi all been on this medication for over 4 weeks and have never felt so bad. Stomach aches and diarrhea. Sickness all day, dizziness, tight chest tired all day and sweating like crazy. Its been terrible. I can&#039;t take it anymore. I&#039;m on 50 mg for depression and anxiety. I just want to be happy and not stressed. I don&#039;t smoke or drink. I&#039;m a size 12. 44 year old lady
Quick results with this drug.
I have had three pregnancies and with the first two the morning sickness was bearable enough without medication. This time around I have had trouble making it to work and have been constantly miserable, nauseous and dry heaving. I took my first Zofran last night and the only complaint I have is that I wish it was non-drowsy. I almost fell asleep at my desk today. However, I will take drowsiness over nausea any way. Thank you Zofran.
I just started the patch and I take it with vitamins. Maybe trying this way is more successful.
The best medicine I have taken so far for control of sacroiliac joint pain.  I have been on Oxycontin, Percocet and this patch works better.  The side effects are tolerable.  My only complaints are severe bloating and constipation.  You really have to stay on top of taking a laxative or you will be in bad shape.  But you cannot beat the pain control.  The patch enables me to work full-time at a professional job and remain comfortable..
Invega is a great medication. I can speak more clearly and think more thoroughly. I&#039;ve felt better about myself in almost about 2 years, and I&#039;ve been on this medication for about 2 weeks! I would recommend it to anyone with this diagnosis!
Lexapro is a good anti-depressant (I was perscribed this drug for anxiety but felt very positive after about two weeks). That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant.
I have had wegeners since April 2008.  Medications of prednisone, cyclophosomide, and methotrexate were successful in slowing down the disease. However I still had flareups a two three times yr requiring hospitalization and the resumption of heavy doses prednisone till better, then had to taper back off.   In June 2013 I again was back in hospital and in Sept 2013 I started on Rituxan getting 2 doses 2wks apart &amp; again six months later.  I only take 5 mg of prednisone a day and remain on methotrxate 20mg once per week.  I have eliminated hospital visits &amp; have enjoyed life much more. I am just finishing this month my 2 dose shots &amp; now looking in 6 months reducing it to one dose every six months and reducing my methotreate to 15 mg .Side effects minor
works great most of the time, only thing i can say is that it doesn&#039;t necessarily work for 12 hours but still gets the job done for half that time at least. Usually dims the coughing but doesnt stop it, buy cold medicine to treat the cold
I tried EVERYTHING to get over what was first diagnosed as depression (30 years ago).  About 12 years ago I started seeing a psychiatrist who thought I might be bipolar, type 2 (mostly depressive, no full-blown manic state) and started me on Emsam.  It took some time-can&#039;t really remember but maybe a month but it works.  Yes, there are side effects-insomnia being the worst but that dissipated in a few months.  We all know that what works for one person may not for another but this is not an SSRI which can&#039;t &quot;touch&quot; depression associated with bipolar.  And you don&#039;t have to be bipolar for it to work.  I know it&#039;s frustrating but give it a shot-maybe you&#039;ll be like me and never have to try another medicine again!
This form of contraception is great for preventing pregnancy, there is no worry of forgetting a pill. However after 6 months I&#039;ve just had my implant removed, at first it was fine, although periods are very irregular, they would happen unexpectedly. I suffered from mood swings, depression, low sex drive and acne whilst having the implant. My appetite increased, constantly feeling hungry and I gained some weight. My emotions were all over the place, I found myself getting far too emotional, crying quite a lot! I&#039;m so happy that it is now removed and I can look forward to feeling good again.
Worse pill ever, please do not take and please listen to these reviews. Started out great then started with very sharp pains, was on bed rest and almost rushed to the ER.... no sign of my period but I sure feel it coming because he pain, bloating, cramps, acid reflux, sickness, PMS, mood swings, anger and depression which WON&#039;T STOP. Save yourself the trouble and don&rsquo;t take!!!!
ADHD makes life challenging enough, when the medicines that have worked for you for so many years are not longer available, the challenge grows. My doctor put me on this medicine and lowered the dose ...it&#039;s not working. 
I have been on Saxenda for about 2 months now. I am down 17Lbs. I noticed constipation when I increased my dose to the highest one. .3. Im grateful my insurance covers it. I pay 30.00. I continue to exercise and drink plenty of water. I go back to docotr jan 2017. I started out at a weight of 265 im 249 now. 
After taking the fifth pill I started getting hit flashes and can&#039;t sleep.  My husband and I are praying for a baby within the next month or so.
After these reviews,I understand one thing-all body is different. I am 27,taking orsythia for 1 year and before I took other pills. All of them have the same symptoms. About gain weight-girls you just have to control yourself during taking pills,do sport,eat the same portion of food(not double), have wonderfull relationships and life is wonderfull!!! Moodiness etc... it is not because of pills,it is because of ur thoughts. We use to think that someone or something is guilty in our problems. Boolshet
great product no acne or wrinkles
This was the worst thing ever! I had hot flashes my period was non stop I just bled for months. And the worst thing was I had a low libido I was not interested in sex and could not get wet when aroused and I was only 19! This shot was terrible.
Although everyone&#039;s body reacts differently to each birth control, I thought I would still share my experience. I had a really bad experience on Lutera, so my PCP prescribed me Nuvaring. She explained that it is absorbed through my blood verses the Lutera which was absorbing through my stomach (if that makes any sense). None the less, I agreed to try it and cannot be any happier! I have been taking it for about a week now and have no side effects as of now! It is super, just insert and once its in, you cannot feel a thing. I am so happy with experience, that I had to share! Hope this be useful to someone!
I take Abilify and Lexapro together for Tourette&#039;s Syndrome and the results are excellent. If you have tics which make you uncomfortable in any way, I highly suggest going to a Psychiatrist who specializes in TS and discussing these medications.
It was great, take it at night though to avoid stomach trouble. But it worked great no acne or bleeding.
I started saxenda 3 weeks ago and have lost 7 pounds.  I have hyperlipedemia and high blood pressure plus have been a little overweight.  I have been dieting with no success before this due I believe to stress causing too much coritosol.  I was in nursing school.  I started this stuff after graduation and its working.  I am nauseous after dose increases for about two days.  Have felt tired as well on those days.  I am looking forward to more results!
Last report was 10/29.  Been on saxenda 10 weeks - down 24lbs (goal is 28lbs), dose has stayed at 1.2.  Tried 1.8 for a day but felt nauseous. Before saxenda my cravings for bread, sweets and a glass of wine after work almost every day were awful.  Following my doctor&#039;s diet and using saxenda - cravings barely exist.  Only 1 glass of wine in 10 weeks and a few pieces of Halloween candy twice.  Before saxenda I would&#039;ve finished the bag.  I use miralax every other day and feel a little more tired than usual, but no major problems.  A bit afraid of what happens when I reach my goal soon, but the saxenda experience with little to no cravings has really made me think about my behavior and the triggers that make me want to eat for no reason.
I&#039;ve been taking rosuvastatin for about two months now and had a blood test taken after five weeks on it. Overall levels went  from 266 to 147, LDL 169 to 73, HDL 48 to 44, and Trigs from 250 to 150. I didn&#039;t really make much effort to change diet as I wanted to get a good idea of what the drug was doing on its own. I will make necessary diet changes and try to get the numbers down a bit more so that I can either take the medication less often or perhaps switch a lower dose. Fortunately, I&#039;m not experiencing any adverse side effects. Seems to be a pretty effective drug if you can tolerate it.
This was my first birth control and I found a few pros and cons with it. I used it for 3 months. Pros: shorter and lighter period, and little to no cramps. Cons: vaginal dryness, vaginal sensitivity, very low sex drive, very bad acne. I switched to another pill since it wasn&#039;t for me. However, just because it didn&#039;t work for me doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t work for other people.
This is a MIRACLE DRUG for me! Within 1 hour of taking 100mg I felt the fog lift! The productive part of my brain started working again. I actually got up and starting doing things, instead of laying in my bed anxious and overwhelmed about EVERY part of my life. I started only 3 days ago and this is the best 3 days I have had in years (I&#039;m 33), with the exception of the time I spent on Phentermine for weight loss. I also take 50mg of Trazodone at night and have been on that for most of 4 years. I was still depressed and increasing Trazodone to 100mg made me exhausted. My ADD hyperfocus was beginning to take over my life, but WOW what a difference using this NDRI had made! SSRI&#039;s made me suicidal and caused me horrible panic attacks.
I have had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep for a long time, but with 3 mg of melatonin I fall asleep fast and stay asleep which is very nice.
I have been taking  citalopram for a year.  I take 20 mg tablet once a day.  I also have Crohns Disease.  It was my family that urged me to do something about my mood swings. They and I have noticed a tremendous diffence in me.  I love the way this medicine makes me feel like me again.
I took this medication for 2 years and found little trouble with it. Occasionally I would have longer periods, but more often than not I wouldn&#039;t have one at all. On average, I&#039;d say I had a period every 2 months and every 4th period lasted for a week. I took this as an alternative to most birth controls, which were giving me migraines. This one only gave me a slight headache around the last couple days of the inactive pills and the first couple of days starting a new month, but nothing too terrible.
I had my first yeast infection and was prescribed this pill. It did slow down the discharge but the itch was still severe along with swelling. I waited the seven days and still no improvement. I decided that it needs to touch the infection and purchased clotrimazole 3 day and had awesome results.
So this was the first birth control I had taken and everything was fine the first three days, on the fourth day I randomly got sick, like hot flashes, lightheadedness, headaches, and vomiting, but after an hour and a half it went away. However from that day on I always felt a bit off and had lightheadedness and headaches for an hour or so every day always at a different time even though I took my pill at the same time every day. My period came early and I have never experienced such extreme cramping before. The only plus is that it didn&#039;t kill my sex drive and I didn&#039;t get pregnant
I was addicted to Heroin for almost three years. I tried everything from Suboxone to methadone to tapering and even cold turkey but Subutex was the only thing that worked. Subutex has truly saved my life.
I love these. My fianc&eacute;e has been struggling with intense constipation. She hasn&#039;t had a bowel movement other than a few bunny poops in two weeks. We finally decided to do the enema. The top is incredibly easy to push it. She said it was s tiny bit uncomfortable but didn&#039;t hurt. I squeezed about 1/4-1/2 into her rectum, at times slowly and other times quickly accidentally before she screamed to take it out and rushed to the bathroom. She&#039;s been having a successful bowel movement for ten minutes! That&#039;s how much was impacted. And it only took three minutes of this enema to get it out!
I&#039;m a 19 year old female and I suffer from insomnia. I talked to my doctor about my horrid sleeping habits. I have a rough time falling asleep and when I do I only get about an hour of sleep. His first thought was to prescribe a 5mg dose of ambien. I was shocked as my knowledge of the drug was that it had a heavy impact and could cause you to not remember the night you took it. When I got home that night I got ready for bed, took the dose, and laid down. After an hour or so it finally kicked in but all it did was give me a sense of not being in the correct mindset. Just being a bit off. It didn&#039;t help me fall asleep whatsoever. In fact it caused me to remain alert and awake. My results were the complete opposite of its intended use.
62 yr male, with low Testosterone, erectile dysfunction problems. Blood pressure was 147/90. Tried Lisinopril, very allergic with much sinus drainage and cough it took 3 months to get rid of. Controlled blood pressure well, and actually relieved erectile dysfunction problems. Had to go to amlopidine which controlled BP and had no side effects but complete sexual dysfunction, so went to Losartan. No side effects, 50 mg has my BP at 117/70 and again, notably relieved ED problems and enhanced sex life. 
Opana is a great pain killer but relief lasts only 4-5 hours. One has to take another pain killer such as hydrocodone in conjunction with Opana. Also, Opana cost me $400 a month for sixty 60mg pills. My doctor switched me to Morphine-sulfate. I&#039;ll let you know how I go on this medicine.
I have used etodolac for many years.  When I don&#039;t take it, I have to think about my knees with every step.  When I do take it, I can walk without being aware of my knees.  For me it has been very helpful.
I have been taking Azor for about 2 years.  I am, now, beginning to experience severe side effects (especially, hives and itching).  I am miserable.  Occasionally, my tongue and fingers swell.  I have reported it to my doctor.  He has given me a prescription to counteract the itching and suggested that I take Benadryl.  Benadryl makes me so sleepy and incoherent.  However, this medication (Azor) is definitely working for my blood pressure; which was 180  over 100 .  With the Azor it goes down tremendously.  How can this decrease my blood pressure, yet makes me sick otherwise.
I&#039;ve been taking Bydureon for 1 month. So far, although I am skeptical by nature, it seems like a miracle. I had been eating Paleo for about 3 months, but was only losing 1 lb per week and still seeing fasting numbers around 150. My doctor put me on Bydureon and I lost 10 lbs just the in the first two weeks, and that included a few freakout days when I was eating Olive Garden, Taco Bell, and Braums ice cream multiple times per day. In one month, I&#039;ve lost a total of 21 lbs, dropping from 263lbs to 242lbs, with no other lifestyle changes. I have not been back yet to check my A1C as doc wants to wait a full three months, but posting numbers of 90 - 100 upon waking and 110 - 120 after meals, it stands to reason this would also have improved greatly.
I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety my whole life. I&#039;ve been on an off so many different medicines I can&#039;t even count. At first, Effexor seemed like a heaven send. Recently though I&#039;ve realized that if I merely skip a day or more.. The withdrawals are indescribable. I shake constantly. I throw up. I sweat. I get headaches. 
Several years ago my life long difficulties with startles escalated to classic hyperekplexia.  After some research, my suggestions to both a geriatric psychiatrist and movement disorder specialist agreed to try Klonopin ... .5 mg twice/day.  Worked fine to decrease intensity and frequency of &quot;attacks.&quot;  I also have dystonia and as the cervical &quot;storms&quot; increased, they increased Klonopin to .5 three times a day.  Helped some but does not extinguish the disorders ... nothing will.  One just has to avoid the &quot;triggers,&quot; if possible.
Made me a zombie at low doses and didn&#039;t help with depression. In fact, I felt even more depressed since I wasn&#039;t able to hold a conversation or think straight due to drowsiness.But it seems to work for some people.
Been on this for several years and it works very well for my post traumatic stress disorder.
I used Toviaz for 10 days and its side effects started to be unbearable. So i had to give it up.. Maybe if i would continue to use, it could show its true effects but dry mouth and dizziness made me very bad..
This stuff does not work. I would not recommend. I&#039;ve been using this stuff all week whilst having a cold, I&#039;m still blocked up. Do not use
I used Periactin for approximately 6 months to relieve an allergic reaction and it worked extremely well. It did make me drowsy though, therefore I halved the dose I was recommended.
Started using the product several years ago.  Have re-ordered several times.  Have been to two other doctors in past 5 years who were not familar with Bensal, however they wrote a prescription when I told them of my experience.
Started taking Victoza at minimum dosage and my blood glucose has gone down from the 180&#039;s to between 110 and 140.  I have also lost 4 pounds in just about a week...but diet and exercise is part of the regimen.  No side effects, and looking forward to continued glucose health!
When I first started using contraception, I was put on the pill and it really messed with my emotions, plus I&#039;d end up forgetting to take it every day, so I tried Implanon. During the first year of insertion, it did cause my periods to become heavier, longer and less predictable. However, after a few months, they lessened to the point where I no longer had a period anymore (huge bonus). Anyway, I&#039;d highly recommend implanon as a form of contraception and will continue to use it myself. Hope this helps!
I&#039;ve been taking this pill for months now &amp; I always feel dizzy and lightheaded in the mornings. I&#039;m not sure if this is all just the pill but I didn&#039;t start feeling this way till I got on it. I feel like throwing up. If I smell food, see food, or even try to eat it I want to throw up so bad. Maybe I should eat when I take it? I&#039;m not sure but the feeling sucks so much because I&#039;m in highschool dealing with it. It lasts about an hour and a half then I feel just fine. It stopped for about a week and now it&#039;s back and j sorta felt it all day.
Adalat 60mg helps my high blood pressure but I have to go to the bathroom a lot.
I had migraines from when I was about 17 y/o and now I am a Senior. I was started on Cafergot, 2 to start at the beginning of a headache and then one every 1/2 an hour but no more than 6 pills/headache.  Then the doctor added a pain pill and later on a Xanax. The combination worked very well but the headache neurologist suggested one medication per day to keep the headaches away. He started me on Bellermine. But it didn&#039;t do what he expected. There were some side effects I didn&#039;t like. Unfortunately  he passed away so I had to find another headache neurologist. In NYC we have  lots of doctors to choose from. I found one who listened to my story. At the end of my story he prescribed Methergine.  I haven&#039;t had a headache since the late 1990s.
It doesn&#039;t eliminate all of the anxiety, but it takes the big edge off, enough for you to calm down on your own.
Librax saved, saved, my life!  After suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome- Constipation, for about 30 years, and all sorts of anti-spasmodics that did nothing... whatsoever, my Dr. Prescribed Librax. I only have to take one pill at the first signs of that old familiar gut wrenching pain and it all melts away in about 20 mins. I don&#039;t know what I would do without it.
I&#039;m on month 3 taking this after being forced to switch from Minestrin FE (I really liked this one) due to insurance changes. I&#039;d been on BC for many years but so far I&#039;m not too happy with this one, especially when it is supposed to be very much like the Minestrin. Month one I had bloating and breast pains, month two I was getting headaches about every other day (not migraines, just annoying). I&#039;ve learned to give a change of BC 3-4 months before deciding. I&#039;ve had less headaches this month but I&#039;ve still had more than I ever had with Minestrin. Periods are very light and are lasting only a day or so. I got a discount card from my doctor to help pay for this prescription FYI saving me about $200.
I have had cholinergic urticaria for a few years now. I break out into hives when I start exerting myself physically or it&#039;s hot. After taking Zyrtec 1/2 an hour before my workout, I didn&#039;t experience that irritating itchy feeling all over nor did I get hives. My skin got red but no bumps. I don&#039;t care as long as I don&#039;t get the irritation which works to create an aversion to exercise. I took a 5 mg dosage. After my workout, I went to sleep at 7 p.m., woke up for an hour and then went to bed at 9 p.m. only to sleep the whole following day. I was unusually fatigued and sleepy. I&#039;m going to try 2.5 mg today to see if that helps.
This was the second antidepressant I tried, worked great for a few months be then it went downhill fast. I stop shortly after it got really bad, however Prozac withdrawal is one of the most emotionally and physically challenging things I&#039;ve ever done. I do not advise people with even slightly addictive habits to take this, I truely do not like this med, at all, but maybe it works for some people.
I&#039;m at the end of my 3 years and I&#039;m ready to get another one inserted. It&#039;s been a dream so far though my results aren&#039;t typical. I have only had one period since having the Implanon insertion which is amazing. The insertion leaves you a bit sore and makes showering a little tricky but it&#039;s only for a few days. I am a little scared for the extraction but you don&#039;t feel any pain because they numb you.
I have trouble staying asleep. I wake every night anywhere from between 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. and am up for the rest of the night. This medicine helped me sleep, but also made me very depressed.  It made me very angry and upset most of the time. I took this for about 3 months, until I got to the point that there was something very wrong with me and it was the medicine.  
I got checked by the Urgent clinic today who were very helpful. Upon being diagnosed with Bronchitis I was prescribed the 100mg Tessalon. I SPECIFICALLY asked the doctor if this would make me drowsy, because I am a teacher and have to return to work ASAP. Nope, he assured. Well, not only did I spend the rest of the evening hiding from lights and sounds due to an explosive headache (which ached every time I coughed) but my temp went up and I am now extremely exhausted. What is the deal with this stuff?? I haven&#039;t stopped coughing and feel ten times worse.
I have been on pretty much every anti-depressant out there for the last 7 years.  The last few were Lexapro 20 mg, then switched to Zoloft, which made me feel like I wasn&#039;t on anything at all and I began having anxiety which turned into panic attacks. I was put on Ativan 1.5 mg a day and 20 mg Paxil, which was raised to 40mg.  This past year I was diagnosed with ADD, so Adderall XR was added....can&#039;t remember the dose because I had an allergic reaction, and moved on to Focalin XR.  I thought they both worked very well.  I was totally on target, focused and awake. However my jaw felt clenched a lot which gave me headaches. I saw a new PCP last week who put me on Pristiq and took me off everything else. It makes me so sleepy, but so far so good!
My experience. Man I&#039;ve used heroin since I was 16 years old. Finally found suboxone 7 years ago. Started at three 8 mg strips a day. I still used here and there. Two years ago I was put on zubsolv having weaned myself a lil over the years I was put on an 8.6 a day equal to a 12 and never used since being on it. I feel great, make 80 grand a year, have no side effects besides my teeth but now have implants. The world is an awesome place. Zubsolv saved me. I was still using 4 out of 7 days with the strips now I won&#039;t even answer my phone to old drug friends. It&#039;s a whole new life
I&#039;m sixty-eight years old and have dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life.  There were some medicines over the years that helped, but for one reason or another, I had to stop taking them. But five years ago (July 17,2007) I had an acute neurological episode that awoke me from sleep straight into a Carnival Midway atmosphere. Very disturbing, and my sleep was never restful from that day forward. Four different polysomnograms verified I was getting less than a third of normal REM sleep.  Six months ago I discovered Ambien and was quite pleased, but I was recently to see a pain management doctor who understands the value of good sleep in dealing with chronic pain; his preference is Trileptal so I went on it. Never felt this relaxed and normal.
I got Kyleena put in on 8/31, it&#039;s been two weeks and I&#039;m loving the peace of mind my boyfriend and I have now. I was not on birth control prior, but the insertion was so painful for me. Apparently I have a tilted uterus, so my cervix had to be tilted to line it up, that was rough. They had me sit for about 5 min before leaving, I did feel a little lightheaded. I drove home with extreme cramps and was in my bed with a heating pad and ibuprofen for the rest of the day. Cramps eased by morning and are much better now but I can still occasionally feel small ones. I have been spotting dark blood off and on since insertion but I feel hopeful my body will start to regulate itself to the IUD soon.
I&#039;ve use this med when I was in high school, it dosen&#039;t work at all for me . I was following the dosage and nothing happen at all. With this med I&#039;ve had the worst and longest outbreak so far it lasted for about 20+ day . I tried polysporin patch it works a little bit. The main thing that I do to heal the outbreak , its taking 750 mg of magnesium a day with L lysine 2000 mg a day with zinc 50 mg a day, potassium works too. The main thing you should focus on its your diet I put some garlic on the sore when it appears but like HELL but it seem to work. For the sleeping time I put ( de l&#039;argile blanc ) from Lancome its a mask that if you apply on the lips and sores it will keep it dry. This is what works for me now. I hope to discover some new remedy in the future.  Sorry for my bad english I&#039;m french from Canada and I wish nothing but the best for you all.
I have been on Phentermine for 66 days, take 37.5 mg/day, and lost 10 lbs. However as of tomorrow I will stop taking it. It has caused a very negative change in my thoughts &amp; personality &amp; causes huge mood swings. After being on it for 2 weeks I started noticing I was super sensitive, however blamed it on PMS at the time. It hasn&#039;t gotten better though. I have been irritable, angry, restless, &amp; just general feelings of sadness. The past couple days I also have been noticing &quot;flashes&quot; of something dark on the floor out of the corner of my eye but when I look in that direction nothing is there. When I read these are rare side effects I decided I need to stop taking it.
The brand shown worked very well for me.  Would only need one when in pain during the night.  I can manage the days but at night without this it would be no sleep and pacing all night  . Even a half worked well sometimes but other times I would have to take the other half. I suggest taking as little as possible to just ease the pain and nothing more.
Like many others, have suffered from tension and/or migraine headaches since I was a child (age 7 or so).  My mother and father both had histories of tension and/or migraine headaches.  I was prescribed initially fiorinal, around age 15, and then changed to fioricet by my neurologist due to upper gi problems (gerd).  Until I had this medication prescribed,  my life was controlled by my headaches.   I can remember as a teenager, feeling that I couldn&#039;t be away from home for very long due to fearing a headache would come on.   No child or adult should have to feel that way!   I wish that all the physicians who are uncomfortable prescribing this medicine would read these comments!  Thank you.
I like using Percocet for my back pain. It helps more than other pain pills that I&#039;ve taken before. Lortab didn&#039;t do anything or Ultram. I do have a scheduled epidural for my back this week. So, hopefully when, I get that shot I might not need to take as many Percocet! I also, have to take Zanaflex, Muscle Relaxer&#039;s twice a day for my spasms. They just make you really tired. So, if you have to drive I wouldn&#039;t take the muscle relaxers. 
I have been injecting once a week for two months.  I have suferred disgusting belching, lack of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting.  I am fortunate to be working but I am off sick again because I cannot venture outside of the house because of liquid pouring out of both ends!!   When I vomited this morning a lump of gunk surfaced which I think was the coagulated bydureon.  I am not willing to take this awful drug again.  The side effects do not outweigh benefits.
I have been on the Depo shot for 21 years.  I have always loved this type of birth control.  First year, period was unpredictable.  But ever since, wonderful not having one.  About ten years ago, I read in a magazine about the Depo causing problems with bones, while sitting in doctors office to get my shot.  I asked the nurse about it and she advised me to get a bone density test, which I did.  The doctor called me when he got the results and asked why I would take such a test and was not happy that I did.  So I keep it with my records and kind of forgot about it.  Went in this month to get my shot and the doctor informed me that this would be the last shot he gives me, that he is going to refuse any future shot. Not Happy! Loved Shot!
i have always been scared of public speaking. I usually experience sweaty hands, flushed face, and worst of all a shaky voice. I&#039;m in my first year of college and had a presentation assigned. I was nervous for months before the day I had to present. a week before the presentation, I talked to my doctor and was prescribed 20mg. I took one an hour before my presentation. I still felt nervous leading up to the presentation and even when I was up front. but once I started speaking, I realized my voice wasn&#039;t shaking despite how nervous i felt! I couldn&#039;t believe it, I could speak normally through the whole thing. I still experienced sweaty hands, but that doesn&#039;t really bother me anyway.
I was diagnosed with ms in May 31 2016. First we wanted to do tecfadra but insurance wanted me to do something cheaper. In that time I had a horrible relapse. So we choose tysabri my doctor said it was the only other drug strong enough to deal with my ms. After my 4th infusion I tested JC positive and had to be hospitalized. I am no longer on it and I am not a fan of it
Fantastic medicine! I have insomnia, depression and anxiety. Helps me fall asleep and sleep hard all through the night. I wake up feeling refreshed. This pill gives me lots of energy. Imy back on my bicycle and hitting my home gym daily. I feel confident in myself for the first time and almost feel guilty for not having constant self depreciating thoughts. Thankful God has given me powerful healing in this medicine. A tool against the devil, I no longer hear his lies so much. Living happily 
Subtle, but highly effective. Combine 5mg with 30mg Cymbalta. I was on 60mg Cymbalta, titrated Brintellix to 10mg, but experienced discomfort  (heightened anxiety and weird burning feeling.)  I lowered Cymbalta dose to 30mg a day, an immediate relief from the anxiety. However it crept back,  and I concluded it was an interaction leading to accumulation of Brintellix and went back to 5mg of it. Now after three months I start to get used to that it actually works. Only discomfort is occasionally feeling nauseous (after eating sweets  or pastry on an empty stomach.) 60mg Cymbalta helped me for years with depression and anxiety, however leaving me foggy. The new combination is totally unnoticeable except from making me calm and happy.
I have been taking Minastrin for over two years now. Acne was never a severe problem for me but I now only break out (usually just a few zits/pimples, nothing major) during the last week of the pack like clockwork. I did gain weight, however the time frame does coincide with my &quot;freshman 15&quot; so I don&#039;t think I can blame it entirely on this medication. It does make me a bit moody, but predictably so. This is the only birth control I&#039;ve ever tried, and honestly I only have chosen it since it&#039;s completely covered by my insurance. It works well enough (I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant) but I am thinking about switching to an IUD since I am worried about drug interference and the risk of blood clotting.
After years of knee problems and taking cortisone I was recommended by a knee specialist to try Synvisc One injections.  After approximately $635 and an extremely painful injection (much more painful than cortisone) I had absolutely no relief whatsoever just a waste of time and money.  Now I am back on cortisone injections until they can come up with another alternative :(
I have extremely bad coughing spells at night. So my doctor prescribed Codeine cough syrup which surprisingly did not help because it is a pretty strong cough medicine. So instead he prescribed Tussionex for me. The medicine worked great! The only thing I don&#039;t like is it made me sleep all day long and the next day I could still feel it in my system but I know I could have probably slept for 2 days straight off of the small dose he prescribed. He told me to do &quot;Take 1 teaspoonful 2 times a day&quot; I only did one and it made me feel very tired. But it does A GREAT job with suppressing the cough.
Have been taking Jalyn for 3 months.  Did experience better urine flow and less trips to the bathroom at night.  Side affects are:  constipation, dry ejaculation (no semen), decreased libido, dizziness and hip pain.  Might consider switching medication depending if side effects worsen.
I am writing a review on the insertion of this product. I am 22 years old and have had two C-sections and never been dilated once. The insertion feels no more than a Pap smear and was just a little bit of pressure. I did not experience any pinching or cramping and almost decided not to get it because of all of the scary reviews. Since I had Skyla placed about seven hours ago I have not had any  cramps whatsoever. Just a little bit of bleeding. Also I am breast-feeding and so far so good I will write a review further down the line to see how I like it I highly suggest it so far as the insertion was a breeze and I was petrified to even go forward with it !
I felt 1000 mg of Excedrin in morning helped with the pain all day long.
This does the job for mellowing you out then out you will be like a light. It makes you very hungry though and you may find it tricky at first getting out of bed at high doses. If you need a sleep this is perfect, remember its not the quantity of the sleep its the quality. This for sure gives you the quality.
I&#039;ve had the Mirena for a few months. The insertion wasn&#039;t uncomfortable at all. However, at first I bled for 3 months straight after insertion then one day it just stopped. Then I got a light period for a week and a half the following months. I now have acne that I&#039;ve never had, the menstrual cycle lasts longer then it normally did, and I&#039;ve gained weight.
I had paragard inserted 8 weeks after my 2nd baby was born (2years back).The process was not painful but uncomfortable. Paragard has helped me in having no pregnancies- so it does what its supposed. But at the cost of what! I was 5&#039;3&#039; 120lb when I got it. I started gaining weight not sure whether paragard is to blame. My periods are so heavier that I can&#039;t use tampons, and have to change the thickest pad every 2 hours for 2 days out of 5 days. My blood tests shows I am anemic despite the fact I am particular about diet. I have had constant yeast infections , 1 episode of UTI which I never had before in my life. There is a constant discharge, and pantyliner is a must.  I&#039;m getting removed. Pattern-most bad reviews are by people who had it for a while.
This medication so far has been working quite well for me. I just finished my first 2 week dose today and I am down 16 pounds. The first week felt like I was starving with the diet the nutritionist had put me on , but into the second week that faded away and I was satisfied with my smaller portions. I had less interest in food and felt fuller faster. Tomorrow I will begin the the next dose up of the medication and I am looking forward to seeing how much weigh loss is in store for me. I was told by the doctor today that the medicine is designed to help you lose 5 percent of your total weight loss. So my next visit with her she expects another 10 pounds which will put me at 26 pounds in 6 weeks that is more than what she originally expected
I had been backed up for at least half a year when things went from bad to worse. The last two months, I was lucky to go once a week. My stool was so hard and big that it hurt to much to go. My doctor prescribed Miralax to me and it started to work a little. Then, she recommended I take two cap fulls in two cups of water instead of one in one. After a day or two, I went to go and it literally went from 100% bad to 100% great. I was not only able to go but it didn&#039;t hurt at all. It was so amazing to finally not be in pain that I literally cried. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with that kind of constipation.
My first time taking birth control my gyno put me on lo loestrin Fe 1/20 and my hormonal acne cleared up, my sex drive was fine, overall great pill. Then I had to switch to microgestin Fe 1/20 because insurance didn&#039;t cover lo loestrin Fe 1/20. Ever since I started taking microgestin I have had horrible acne and started off with horrible mood swings and I&#039;m on month four right now and have recently been experiencing some anxiety and nausea I think due to this pill. Going to my gyno tomorrow to switch back to lo loestrin fe 1/20 even if it is more costly. Microgestin Fe is horrible I do not recommend especially if you are prone to having acne which is one of the main reasons I started taking BC.
My mother gave this to me as a kid and I had not taken it for probably 30+ years.  I was horribly sick with the flu and had someone pick some of this up for me and it still managed to do the trick.  The secret is to lie still and don&#039;t take any food or drink in for an hour or so.  Works wonders.
stage I breast cancer. I Had lumpectomy no nodes involved. No chemo I chose no radiation.... Been on zoladex and famera so far very few side effects.... But of course I&#039;m just now starting on my second week of use..... I recommend u to get blood work done to check for vitamin deficiencies... And address them it will keep your side effects at a minimum.... 
I wasn&#039;t even able to get through the titration pack &amp; I began experiencing suicidal thought. I&#039;ve experienced it a lot, but this time it was way worse, with the thoughts getting more frequent &amp; graphic. I will admit I have BP &amp; BPD &amp; this may be the reason why I had this reaction. I called my rheumatologist, since she&#039;s the one who prescribed it, to let her know how I was feeling. Long story short, she sent the police to my house &amp; I was taken to the psych hospital, where I sat for a couple of hrs.  It also made my already high blood pressure worse. Also, no pain ease/relief.  Never again for me!
while taking strattera it didn&#039;t really help with my ADHD but it did cause unwanted nausea and once I reached my target 80mg dose I began to get extremely hot then started to sweat a lot and finally threw up the strattera.
Was taking 30 - 40 my hydrocodone, and 300 my tramadol  a day for lumbar for a min all stenosis, I have 4 herniated disks so to L2.  The hydrocodone was just scratching the surface of my pain.  My doctor put me on 100 my Nucynta ER X2 a day and it has been so mutch better.  Had to stop the tramadol.  Still taking the hydrocodone, need to adjust the dose but it has bee much better, almost no side affects.  They do only seem to last for 8 Jr so I will talk to my doc about doing 150 my x3 a day.
I have been on the patch for about 6 months. It has really helped alot. I have not been able to take any oral medcations because they make me very nauseas(?) I can&#039;t wait til a higher dose is approved in the US.    Carole
I was on Betoptic for years and my pressure was still a bit higher than we wanted it to be. After some trial &amp; error, we&#039;ve discovered that if I put the Combigan in one eye and the Betoptic in the other, my pressure is better than it&#039;s ever been. Around 14 which is unheard of me. It&#039;s working great and the only side effect I have is a bit of redness at times.
Wonderful, very quick acting (like, two hours), so watch out for that.  Solves the problem when all else fails.  Expensive.
Oxycontin has really helped me with pain.
I&#039;ve been using Ambien (10mg) for about 2 months and it works great. I suggest going straight to bed after taking it. Also, give yourself 7-8 hours of time to sleep. Ambien knocks me out in 15 minutes and I sleep about 9 hours. Feel great when I wake up. I can&#039;t turn my mind off when I go to bed so it has been a big help. I&#039;m 54 and this is the 1st medicine I&#039;ve taken on a regular basis so I was nervous about taking Ambien at first. It has been great.
Never burned or itched. Worked quickly. Would use again.
Septra DS is excellent for UTI. I have been on it for three days with absolutely no side effects. My UTI has cleared up rapidly. My only criticism is that the pills are rather large and very dry that is probably why it is recommended that it be taken with lots of water.
After having a scary experience with the mirena, I decided to be put on the pill. I took this birth control for 2 1/2 weeks &amp; I was either extremely nauseous or vomiting everyday that I had taken it. I quit taking it about 2 days ago and have felt fine since.
My boyfriend and I had sex we used protection but after we finished we realized that the condom broken so we went to the nearest store and bought Plan B.  I took it during the 24hour period and I had hardly experienced any of the side effects. Then I had to play the waiting game and that was really miserable but I was supposed to start the 26th but it didn&#039;t happen so I started thinking I was pregnant my boyfriend and I  started worrying but then it came today so it worked for me I hope it works for you
I have been experiencing constipation for many years. My doctor reccomended Miralax and Ducalax recently. Not reading all of the reviews and hazards I just bought the medicine. I only took 1 tablet for 1 day. More than 2 hours later I was feeling some horrible, horrible cramps and pain in the stomach. Took many trips to the bathroom and the pain wasn&rsquo;t going away. Worst cramps I&rsquo;ve ever felt. I don&rsquo;t recommend this. Please try to stay away
Working for me. Do experience the nausea, gas, wild dreams (but hilarious and extremely vivid), lower right back pain is bad and a concern. Will continue second 3 month course of treatment. Do still smoke 1-3 per day occasionally, sometimes none. Stubborness I guess. They were my best friend or so I thought for 30 years. Am 45 and logically realize they will kill you or you will be dragging around an oxygen tank when retired instead of walking the beach. I will conquer this task by June 30th !
After much hype that this implant will significantly improve my daughters&#039; lives (both have early puberty and were on lupron shots), this drug did not help deter the symptoms.  We have gone back to the monthly shots.
I&#039;m on my second implant and I&#039;ve been a huge fan from day one. I didn&#039;t have a period before I got my first implant because of a combination of being thin and previous BC and I never got a period after it was implanted until just recently (4.5 years after first implant). I never spotted or anything. The first period I had recently (legitimately first period I&#039;ve had in ~8 years) was completely normal. No cramping, nothing crazy. I know most people hate this thing but I can&#039;t complain, just wish it lasted longer since it won&#039;t be free anymore soon (thanks trump). The only thing I worry about is scar tissue forming from inserting and removing the stick in same area on arm but it hasn&#039;t been an issue yet.
My doctor gave me the injection in his office.  I take no other meds for my diabetes (type 2).  A1C was around 10, triglycerides were 3000, cholesterol was 541.  I also have acute pancreatitis, and later read this med was not good for this pre-existing condition.  That night after the shot, I became ill, lower back pains, an extreme full feeling in my tummy, nausea, and dizziness.  He also prescribed tricore to get my triglycerides down.  I have been sloppy with my diet, and I know what I need to do to change my eating. I honestly can say, after reading other reviews, that this drug scares me, and I wont be buying more.  629 drug interactions I read about on another site and me being fatigued and in a fog for three days, I say no more.
I was taking this bc pill for a couple of years. This last month I have bled heavily for 3 weeks straight. It worked great for a long time so I&#039;m not sure what happened but now I will be changing to a different birth control.
I have used this medication successfully for years. Initially I used it daily for a few weeks, then tapered down to 3 times a weeks, then only 3 days in a row for flare ups. I haven&#039;t used any for 3 years until just recently when I had a flare up. After one dose the redness decreased and no new pustules. The only side effect has been yeast infection when I take higher doses, i.e., twice a day for 5-7 days, but I have not found that I need to do that. I can usually take 50 mg, once a day for 3 days, then I take a dose every other day for 3 days. By then the pustules have resolved and no yeast infection.
It worked after some time
I went on this pill to help control my insane periods and help with my acne. I&#039;m quite young, and my periods would last from 7-10 days. my periods would be so bad that I would throw up, not be able to walk, and faint. So I decided to go on birth control to lighten my periods. my doctor told me to skip the placebo pills every month for 4 months. after the fourth month I got my period, and it made the cramping and blood flow EVEN WORSE! I also went on it to help with acne, and I can say that it has possibly made my acne worse. before going on the pill I rarely got large, hard pimples on my cheeks, and now thats a regular occurrence. if you&#039;re like me, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this pill!!
I am on my 5th week of Loseasonique. I read the reviews beforehand, but decided to give it a shot since I never had any problems with other pills (LoEstren and Ortho TriCyclen) back in the day.  Unfortunately, the bad reviews were right (for me).  I had a little bit of spotting for a few days around week 2, but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle. By week 4, I started spotting, and have continually spotted now going on 2 weeks, now with cramps. It&#039;s not super light spotting either. I do have to wear a panty liner every single day, and of course I don&#039;t want to have sex with my hubby either.  I think I will stick it out through the first 3 month pack, but I will be more than likely try something else next round.
Had shot....shot was nothing...but 48 hrs. later I can barely stand the pain...elevating, ice, ibuprofen....but boy oh boy it hurts BAD. Gave birth to 3 children...one being breech....and swear this pain is worse.....I am hoping to be better soon....with this experience think I will not repeat this adventure. Do not think a knee replacement could be any worse than what I am going through right now!
I was on suboxone strips which was working great for over a year then new insurance put me on zubsolv and the body aches started, constant yawning, then diarrhea. Feels like withdrawals all over again it is miserable and it hurting me at work always tired. Now I pay $650 for my suboxone a month out of my pocket cause insurance covers only some rubbish placebo. Do not recommend can put you back to square one.
Took my first dose this morning! I&#039;m feeling super good about phen. I&#039;m hoping to lose 60lbs. I&#039;m 5&#039;10 and 227lbs!
I have had several doctors perscribe Neurontin for pain. I&#039;ve got degenerative spinal disease with herniation. I also take Tramadol(pain)and Prozac for the depression(side-effect). It&#039;s a shame that the FDA hasn&#039;t passed it for other ailments because it really helps.
Midazolam (a/k/a Versed) has NO pain relieving properties.  It&#039;s given--generally without patient consent--because it reduces anxiety, makes patients compliant/obedient to orders, &amp; causes memory loss (same effects as Rohypnol, date rape drug--they are both benzodiazepines).  Great if that&#039;s what you want &amp; your doc has discussed this with you beforehand.  However, there are many people who have been given Versed without their consent &amp; who have been very upset about the memory loss (see VersedBusters, nomidazolam, etc.--an internet search for side effects of Versed or midazolam will yield a lot of hits).  For both surgeries I had no anxiety yet was given Versed without my consent.  I question why an amnesiac drug is administered when a
Epiduo is the only thing that has worked for me. I had pretty bad acne for two years in highschool. I tried lots of things (proactive) but finally After begging my mom finally purchased epiduo and it was a life saver. For the first month and a half it really dried out my skin and didn&#039;t seem to help much at all, but soon after that I saw a complete transformation in my skin. I no longer have acne like I used to, to this day. But even the weeks that I&#039;ve eaten terribly and slept in my makeup all week (I know I need to stop this). My &quot;acne&quot; is only a few very small pimples that are hardly red. All my friends love it too! Highly recommend this
Remeron helps my depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety. All 3 in 1. I love it!
I have had bad acne and some long periods like 2 months at most during the first year but now I&#039;m starting on year 2 and the bleeding has gone to normal and well the acne I control it with tea tree oil. Yes you get discouraged with the bleeding and the bad acne but just have patience and it will go away. The reason I chose this was because I have already tried the Depo and I felt bad that I worked out so many times and I couldn&#039;t lose weight and with this I can work out and see the weight coming off. Give it a try but have patience.
I&#039;ve had mirena for a month now, other than the off and on bleeding I&#039;ve experienced no crazy hormonal changes or weight gain. I was worried to start a birth control with heavy hormones because everything I&#039;ve tried when I was younger really packed on the pounds. After giving birth to my little one I decided mirena was the right choice for me. I&#039;m super happy so far with my choice although I can&#039;t wait for the constant bleeding to stop but I know it will with time. I also felt nothing with the insertion process but I think it&#039;s because I recently had a baby.
Decreased urine output and extreme difficulty urinating.
Have been on multiple antidepressants in my lifetime, all were duds. They caused weight gain, fluctuating moods, extreme sadness. My doctor has recently prescribed me 20mg of Cymbalta, after 2 weeks I will switch to 40mg, 20mg in the morning and 20mg in the evening. After reading reviews online I am hopeful, as everyone has reviewed it mainly positive. Currently after being on it for 5 days I am experiencing MAJOR nausea. I can barely breathe without wanting to throw up everywhere. Thankfully, a coworker has given me &quot;phenergan&quot;, which is used for nausea, but it is a prescription pill. I called my doctor and explained that this has helped, and she refused putting me on another prescription just to treat the side effects of Cymbalta. SOS!
I tried a whole other whack of anti-depressants before trying Remeron and nothing. I mean, nothing worked for me. In fact, other anti-depressants made me more depressed. I mean seriously deeply darkly depressed but not Remeron. Remeron, honestly, is a dream medicine for me. It has improved my cat allergies by 80%, my sleep by 90% and my mood by 80%. It&#039;s amazing. However, it&#039;s true what they say about the munchies. I have to tell myself, almost nightly, that no, I don&#039;t need to get up and make a stack of pancakes at 11 pm. I have dreams about food, chocolate, donuts. It&#039;s pretty funny. The other side effect is my hands are swollen (edema), that side effect I&#039;m not liking but we&#039;ll see how it goes. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 months now.
I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft 100mg for about 6 months now, it really has changed my life. Before medication, I wasn&#039;t leaving the house, had very little social contact and my anxiety was through the roof. Zoloft has been amazing for me, my mood has improved and I&#039;m getting out of the house and keeping in touch with friends and family. I still have my bad days and also feel groggy most mornings but other than that I&#039;ve had great results while taking Zoloft.
I&#039;ve been on Yasmin for about a year now. I was on Ortho-Tri for a few years prior to that, and Nordette (another birth control pill) a few years prior to that one. Because I&#039;ve been on a pill for so long, my body didn&#039;t need much adjusting to Yasmin, nor did I notice any HUGE side effects. Although, after reading some reviews, I have noticed that I feel more sensitive emotionally now since being on Yasmin, I don&#039;t feel like I get mood swings per say where I&#039;m mad, more like its easier for me to cry for something I normally wouldn&#039;t have cried so easily before. Also, I&#039;ve noticed more frequent migraine headaches, and my hair is thinner but despite this, I think its still the best one for me out there. They all have pros, cons, and risks!
Do not use. It did not work as an effective birth control. Was successfully on the pill for 5 tears got pregnate on the shot.
I had the Mirena inserted in April 08 to control heavy bleeding from Adenomyosis. My doctor had recommended it 2 years prior and I balked at getting it because of &quot;horror&quot; stories I read. Now I wish I had given it a try when she first recommended it. It has been great. I had some light spotting the first 2 months, then no period for a couple months. Had a very light period in February. It has changed my life. I have put on some additional weight, approx 8 pounds since I had it put in but I already was struggling with weight so don&#039;t know if it is from that or from middle age. Working on that now with exercise and diet. I am very happy with it. I have my life back each month instead of being afraid to leave the house because of heavy bleeding.
Opana ER is the 1st ER medication that I&#039;ve tried that actually works for an extended period of time. And I&#039;ve had to try many for my severe back and neck injuries. One 20mg pill will last at least 8 hrs, and I work long 16 hr days so that&#039;s a very good thing. I highly recommend it for people with severe problems/injuries. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend it for just mild to moderate pain problems or acute problems. Most ideal for people with chronic severe injuries who also work a lot.
I got the implant because it seemed logical choice for a fast paced lifestyle where you can&#039;t remember everything. So I switched to it, the insertion was a little painful but healed quickly. I had no serious effects except acne really bad the first few weeks. Then about a month in I started my period on it and had chest pain and numbness in my right arm so I got it removed. And learned I have nerve damage from it. Would I recommend this to someone else no, it still has some kinks to be worked out. But everyone is different I wish I never would have gotten it.
I am me again my premenstual Dysphoric disorder was destroying my relationship with others and with myself. For a week to two weeks a month I had severe depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and interpreted others actions as hostile. I would feel at times like breaking up with my boyfriend leaving my family and job and saying f u to life. This is the second time I have taken fluoxetine over long periods of time. Last time I stopped cold turkey (many years ago) thinking I was cured of my PDD. However over the years it worsened until I lived in fear of it. Now I really see understand and feel grateful for the effects of fluox. I feel I am clear, in control, calm and me again.  It has improved my relationship with everyone. The side effect -breast growth! WIN!!!!!
At 17 years old I have finally seen a rheumatologist. I got, a shot of corticosteroid which immediately made my knee and back feel 100% better. And a starter pack with 12 Celebrex samples. The celebrex didn&#039;t cause any noticeable side effects and the pain eased. I finally have my own prescription of Celebrex. I take it every now and then if the pain is not bearable. But I like to just ride out with no medication because I&#039;m used to the flare ups. I feel weird about taking Celebrex everyday because it is a black box drug; I&#039;m too young to start damaging my liver. All in all; Celebrex works when you need it.
I have been taking for four months. Have not had a period the entire time. No other side effects. Im not concerned im pregnant, so have not taken any tests. I have two children and am not experiencing any pregnancy symptoms. A back up method was used for the first three months
Fiorinal is the ONLY pain medicine that will help my headache to any degree of satisfaction.  Thanking God for it.
This drug made me feel as if I was always running out of time, as if I couldn&#039;t stop and enjoy anything. I felt down most of the time on it; not significantly so but enough to make want to quit it.
Hey all you people having bad dreams I have a suggestion. Take a 5mg Melatonin. That&#039;s what I do and haven&#039;t had a bad dream yet.
On first day severe nausea headache and vomiting. Couldn&#039;t get out of bed and had to stop taking.
I had to confirm pregnancy at the doctors, and decided to get an STD test. I&#039;m not only pregnant, but also have chlamydia. I took 2 500mg about an hour before work. I&#039;m a server at a fine dining restaurant, started to not feel too hot when I got there. About an hour into the shift I&#039;m already nauseous and I get a table. By the time I&#039;ve got their order in I&#039;m in a cold sweat and experiencing a lot of stomach pain. In the 5 worst stomach pains I&#039;ve ever had, and I was diagnosed with celiac when I was 20. I&#039;ve had this before. So I go to the bathroom and lo and behold it was the worst kind of diarrhea. Which continued after I was sent home. I learned my lesson about not researching things before I take them.
I&#039;m 37 and my doctor advised me to take 1/4 of a 20 mg pill and the results were....nothing the first time. I took it on an empty stomach as advised. I tried 1/2 of a pill a week later two hours after I ate and the results were....nothing once again. I&#039;m going to take the whole 20mg next week.  
I had the skyla put in after the doctors took me off of the pill after 5 yrs due to hemorrhaging. The first 3-4 months i didnt get my period and when i did it was light spotting for a few days. The strings sometimes poked my boyfriend during sex and once in a while hurt me. After about 6-7 months my period would come 2 weeks later and i would bleed for 2+ weeks. From the beginning i got excruciating cramps (when i was supposed to get my period) where i would have to stay home from work/school and stay in bed. Nothing helped with the cramps, so i decided to get it removed.
After getting a blistering skin rash from Lamictal, Topamax was prescribed.  It did decrease my appetite- I went from 209 lbs back to my regular 135 which I hadn&#039;t been in 7 years. This took place in about 10 months.  At abt the same time I started taking it, I was rearended and suffered a MTBI and scored very low on my neuropsych exam. My old psychiatrist retired and the new psychiatrist is against Topamax bc of the &quot;foggy&quot; side effects that are common.  Now, a little over a year later, I feel ok abt this med considering the alternatives- wish there were better alternatives!
Ok, I&#039;m gonna give you advise if you have never taken this medicine before, make sure you have the next day off. Don&#039;t try to take this med before bed, thinking you&#039;ll have one go at the toilet and your ready to go. Second I would try changing your diet, an enema or even miralax before considering this med. I was having stomach pain and had an xray of my stomach and my Dr showed me how stopped up I was, it&#039;s amazing how much the body can hold. Anyway I say all this because it does clean u out but yes your cramps are close to something like food poisoning cramps, because it&#039;s forcing ur body to do something it can&#039;t effectively do on its own. I hope this helps.
For a little over a year I have been on Lo Loestrin Fe. It&#039;s great, after the first month no more cyst symptoms, my period which has been heavy (Super tampon had to be changed every 2 hours or flooding would occur) is now down to extreme lite spotting on the last 2 pills only. It&#039;s great, I love it. No more tampons or the resulting cramping. I do not have any period symptoms at all now except a hair trigger temper on the last 2 pills (which coincides with my weekend, so I let my family know not to bother me). After a year this has calmed down though to where its almost not noticeable anymore. There are so many pros to this medicine that having a bad temper for 2 days a month is definitely worth it. But it is expensive.
Best medicine ever!! Have been using it for years...tried everything else. Went to pick up my RX today...Cost $757.00, my insurance wont pay for it anymore. This is crazy!
My doctor changed my drug regimen from abilify to Geodon(120 mg  Then I started experiencing trouble swallowing and headaches. These effects were transient so the doctor asked me to stay on the drug. The condition became worse and I went to an ear, throat, nose doctor. They indicated that I was suffering from GERD and inflammation of the larynx. After a few more weeks I was becoming paranoid and experiencing OCD symtoms. My husband called the doctor and demanded she shift back to abilify. A couple days later all the aforementioned symtoms disappeared. I am sure the drug works for many people but please pay close attention to the side effects I described
Took for the first time last night slept perfect. Did wake up groggy for the first 2 hours, small price to pay. I have been on over ten different meds and this by far works wonders.
I had several days of DHE IV&#039;s, a good try of migraines. A few weeks of injectable DHE and it didn&#039;t do a thing for me.  I wish it worked for my constant headache.  I heard a lot of good things about it.
I have been on clarithromycin for 2 days. The first day I took the medication I experienced voracious hunger pains to where I had to eat a snack ever 30 mins to an hour. The next morning the hunger pains returned; thankfully I had brought a variety of snacks to work, or else I would have been in trouble. Terrible anxiety; I am not sure if it has exacerbated an already existing anxiety disorder or if I am nervous about being on the medicine. I am awake now in the middle of the night because of a irresistible cough. I am wondering if this is allergies or a side effect of the medicine. This is a horrible antibiotic and I am just praying I don&#039;t get the metallic taste in my mouth or the nightmares.
I have used the Dulcolax pink a few times now, and even though it says it gentle, my tummy cramps so bad! It&#039;s just awful when I have to use a laxative. I drink plenty of water so that isn&#039;t the problem. Hopefully I will find a laxative that truly is gentle.
When everything else stopped working this did the trick. I can live again without being in pain.
I&#039;m on Mylans generic version of Generess Fe and so far its been okay. I&#039;ve been on 4 different birth controls in the past year and a half and I was put on this one to try to eliminate a cyst I&#039;ve had since November. While I can say the cyst pain had gone away I have now noticed that I get extremely nauseous on this pill. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just my body adjusting but I feel terrible. I take the pill at 9 every night so I think I have to make sure that I don&#039;t have an empty stomach when I take it. This pill has also made me break out a bit but hopefully that will go away in the next few months.
I had my thyroid removed about 2 years ago. I weighed about 190.  I was put on 125 mcg Synthroid right after the surgery.  I lost about 20 pounds without trying at all.  My dosage was increased to 175 mcg.  I then started gaining weight.  My endocrinologist  increased my dosage to 200 mcg.  My weight went up to 224 lbs.  Never weighed so much before.  I&#039;ve been told by a couple of other doctors that the higher doses of Synthroid should cause weight loss, not gain.  I am 72 years old.  In general, I have aches and pains, something wrong every day.  Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s Synthroid related or not.  But I am very uncomfortable with all this weight, just doing everyday things.
I&#039;m 18 years old. I never been on any other birth control but the 3 months on Depo-Provera...I bled for 2 months as well as depression. I was PMSing the full 2 months. Caused problems in my relationship because of it. 
Initially my breathing improved but within a few weeks the improvement disappeared.  Within a month I was having major side effects including fatigue and headaches.  My kidney function decreased markedly.  It took weeks after stopping Qvar to recover from the experience.
I am currently on my second week of this medication and have noticed a decrease in the urge to smoke. I was a pack and a half a day smoker for 25 years and I am down to a half a pack. This is huge for me. I am totally set on quitting and I believe that this drug is going to kick my habit! Will update when medication is complete.
I have taken Depakote ER for awhile with Lamictal. I have not had a seizure in 34 months. I do have hair loss and weight gain problem.
I stayed on this drug for 5-6 months, but it only helped a little bit.  Was also hard to adjust to, making me very sleepy during the first month.
First three months I spotted almost everyday, then about the fourth month it leveled out...and then I started getting my period twice a month. My mood swings got so bad that I lashed out in rage at my boyfriend for literally nothing. I cry A LOT...and I have weird pains in my breasts in the same spot that never seem to go away. I still have pretty bad cramps when I&#039;m on my period,  so it didn&#039;t help with that. Besides that,  this pill has been reliable and didn&#039;t change my weight,  sex drive,  or give me acne. I didn&#039;t experience nausea or headaches so that was nice. I would recommend any ladies to at least give it a try,  might work for you.
Very good. A little drowsiness after panic subsides, though I&#039;m not sure if this is due to a physiological response to subsiding high levels of hormones associated with fight/flight response (e.g., cortisol and adrenaline) involved in panic attacks.
It works really well. I have bad back pains bad and my spasms get really bad. I take them as the doctor told me to and I feel a lot better now. 
My Mirena has been nothing but a constant source of frustration for the almost two years I have had it. It is now removed. Most prominently, I have always had severe cramping since inserting it (never before was cramping an issue for me). I never really stopped spotting or ever had regular periods. I developed cervical bruising because of it. Nausea was a daily issue. And most recently, I have attended over 10 doctors appointments including three emergency room visits over the course of the last three months, due to ongoing complications with bacterial infections and ovarian cysts resulting in crippling pain. Never before have I had to deal with any of these issues. 
I suffer from lower back pain. I had a back fusion in November 2013 about 6 months ago I started having really bad back spasms around the area they did the fusion which was my L-5/S-1.  They had me on Flexeril but did not help they tried the Valium and it works. I do not take it every day only when I have the spasms between that and the Percocet it is the only thing that works.  But I only take them as needed.
I have been taking Celexa for 4 years.  All of a sudden, it stopped working and I spent 4 days feeling like I didn&#039;t want to live any more.  I had no idea that my body could build up an immunity and it simply would stop working. 
This will knock you out.
I have been on qsymia since 7/20/16 &amp; I have lost 48 lbs!!!! I have had little to no side effects.
I&#039;ve taken one pill of 250mg so far and I&#039;ve had the feeling of throwing up, as well as my boyfriend. I ate a bit before and after and still had that feeling. So far, it&#039;s been working due to no discharge and smell that I usually had. I also don&#039;t have cramps nor burning while urinating.
The only positives I have personally is no side effects and less expensive than other medications for ulcerative colitis. 
I found it to be extremely helpful and love the fact I only have to take it once a week.  I am on my 3rd week now.  The needle size is bigger yes but it does not hurt me to stick myself.  It hurts about the same as poking my finger for my blood sugar meter.  I found through the Bydureon website you can get a card to help with the copay.  Its wonderful to know there are manufacturers that are willing to help those who take their medicines.  Also if you use the freestyle meters you can sign up through Abbot to get a free meter and card to save money on the test strips. 
Took care of L5 S1 back pain. But the nausea is awful.
I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with intrusive thoughts.  This came out of nowhere and I ended up having to take time off work.  One week of sitting on the sofa crying my eyes out and having repeated panic attacks and thinking I was going crazy I then saw my doc.  She referred me to a psychologist and put me on Lexapro 5mg for 4 days and then up to 10mg.  She also gave me Valium to use sparingly initially till my anxiety dropped.  No change week 1 except day 1 where I felt a feeling of euphoria.  Week 2 had increase in anxiety even a panic attack. End of week 3 and I&#039;m back to my old self.  No more anxiety or intrusive thoughts.  I am doing all the things I use to do. I feel normal again.  Lexapro and seeing a psychologist has done wonders. Super happy.
I have been taking Effexor XR for approximately 6 months now.  My hot flashes were very severe.  I would be soaked and wet from top of my head down to my legs.  Cold glass of water hardly touched it.  After taking Effexor I only have little sweating around my head and neck maybe two to five times a month.  It is a great relief.
This medicine does help to a degree, but I do experience break through pain and discomfort. Especially in cold and damp weather, in injury sites from a car accident.
Pleasantly surprised to find that there are an awful lot of drama queens/kings and cry babies on here. The stuff really does not taste all that bad. Started by holding my nose only to end up casually sipping it. Only thing I will say is that you will do yourself a favor to camp out in the bathroom and make yourself as comfortable as possible. Bring laptop, books, Ipad, phone. Your going to be in there for a while. Also a small heater and jacket for when you get some chills. Stay in there for as long as your still going, otherwise I can see how people would have accidents. Good luck!!
The condom broke during sex, I ejaculated and my girlfriend was ovulating. We purchased Plan B and she took it about 7 hours after the mishap. This was March 19th. We stayed relaxed but as the days went by the tension and the stress kept getting worse for us both, her period didn&#039;t come on the day that it was supposed to so she was losing it! I told her to wait a few days and for our surprise the next day her period arrived on April 3rd. Plan B works, it just requires patience. Be safe out there!
I started to take Meridia 2 weeks before Christmas 2008. During my first two weeks I lost 16.5lbs. The following two weeks I lost another 2lbs. I will return to my doctor this week to see how much more I have lost. I have gone from a size 16 to a size 12 in less than 2 months. I feel wonderful, my children have commented on how much energy I now have. However exercise and proper diet is the key, and you need to continue doing so even once you are off. It feels wonderful, I can now wear a bathing suit once again. I started at 174lbs and am now at 151lbs. I recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting into shape and becoming healthy again.
When I was young I used to suffer from anxiety.  After the years its stop on its own. Now that I am living alone all my anxiety came back.  I been taking them for 8 months and let me tell you is the only thing that works. I can now sleep and love to come home. Before I used to get so scared thinking of death all the time. I used to wake up my two kids at 2 in the morning thinking I was dying and I will drive to my moms house. Now I feel like I am living a Normal life.
I&#039;ve been using this medicine for about 7 months now for my kidney disease. Before this medicine I was taking prednisone , and if you don&#039;t know....prednisone is satans pills!! They are absolutely terrible and have terrible side effects. So my kidney specialist wanted me to start taking this instead because it&#039;s better and I have to agree 100%. I don&#039;t have any bad side effects like I did with the prednisone.
I have been on Yaz for a little over 4 months and have been surprisingly happy with it. I had mood swings and was pretty emotional for the first 2 months but it really has gone away. I was also bleeding a little irregularly at first but that also went away. The only complaint I have is that it has killed my sex drive and is causing problems in my relationship. I can&#039;t really ever get wet anymore which never used to be an issue. For that reason, I am switching to Paraguard which is non hormonal. I really wish it didn&#039;t cause me that problem because otherwise I love it!
I have no sex drive and I am always spotting.  The spotting has even gotten worse - now I have two periods a month.  I have been taking the pill for almost a year, and the side effects have not subsided - they have gotten worse.  I had to change birth control because of cost,  I guess you get what you pay for....  Sorry Sprintec my body does not like you.
I was terrified to get this, but made the decision after I could no longer stand being on my birth control pills anymore due to severe migraines and upper lip pigmentation! The process to get this is quick and painless. However, it was very sore and painful the first few days and it did not fully heal, for me, until about a month. I was nervous about the constant bleeding, as a lot of people reported, but only had a period for ten days than nothing since then. No headaches, weight gain, bloating... The only thing is I find I&#039;m more sensitive and moody, but I don&#039;t know for sure. That could just be because I moved across the country at the same time! I can feel the rod and have a tiny bit of pain once in a great while, but nothing bad. I recommend trying.
Wonderful medicine: a miracle for bad headaches.
I&#039;ve had to drink suprep bowel prep kit 5 times . 3 of them because I&#039;m have bowel problems and they are using it to help me go. The other 2 kits are for a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. 2 days before the test I started a bland diet. No meat nothing grease, no bread.etc. 1st prep after a breakfast lunch and dinner of clear liquid I drink it. I took big drinks of the prep followed by some apple juice. I drink 16 oz of prep 16oz of apple juice . Asap I started running to the bathroom,.At 1:30am. Prep 2 same 16 oz prep 16 oz or apple juice plus forgot to mention 2 more 16oz of water with each prep and a cup of hot tea. Day 2 prep kit 2 . Same thing it is now 1:30 am am writing this while doing the deed. I truly hope this work procedure is at 6.
I have been treated with Lexapro, Zoloft, Pristiq, Klonopin and lamictal and none were effective. I have been taking Cymbalta for about one week now, and still don&#039;t feel any different. I wake up every day feeling 100% anxious and find it extremely hard to get out of bed. It has been this severe for about two months now where I feel totally incapable of living. Doctor said to stay on Cymbalta and see if it changes anything. Feeling hopeful!
Insomnia, fatigue, confusion
I&#039;m not perfect with my eating and exercising habits and alas, along with teenage hormones came acne. They&#039;re not horrific, but bad enough to be irritating and painful the week before menstruation. I used to take doxycycline but, even from the beginning, it gave me really bad nausea and headaches. I haven&#039;t noticed anything too bad with the sun exposure on the minocycline but have had more drowsiness and am currently experiencing headaches and dizziness. It cleared up everything along with my use of a Clarisonic and a benzyl-based topical cream. Definitely try it if other tetracyclines didn&#039;t work out for you. This one, despite the side effects, is doing the trick.
I was on the 20mg patches they made me sick and black out.  I have been reduced to 10mg ones seem to be working good so far in very to little to no pain for the first time in my life these patches are a savior anyone that deals with chronic pain and is on opioid tablets I&#039;d recommend the switch :)
I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Constipation 15 years ago and severely suffered with constipation since then.  On average I would do a bowel motion once every 2 1/2 to 3 weeks....no exaggeration.  I requested a colonoscopy after a friend of mine suddenly died of colon cancer at the age of 31.   Year ago my PCP introduced me to Linzess.  It took a month for my body to adjust.  I do have occasional diarrhea with it but I will take it over constipation any day! It&#039;s been a year and I am down to taking it once a week and rather then have a bowel motion once or twice a month. I go once or twice a day lawlessly with no issues whatsoever. It has acted almost like a cure for my condition.  Thank GOD for Linzess!
Tegretol is very effective for my mood swings and hallucinations. It helps slow the racing thoughts and hyperactivity and thinking people are out to get me and helps with hearing voices. When I do not take it, everyone can notice a huge difference in how I act.
The pink coated prenatal made me nausious. I switched to these G12 prenatals last week. My nausea disappeared. I took these vitamins 3 years ago. They worked wonders for my hair and nails.
I&#039;m almost due for my 5th shot (almost a year) and I noticed last night that I had some irregular bleeding. Woke up and it had continued. Tad worried but I haven&#039;t had anything like this since I got my 2nd shot so I think I&#039;m okay. Will chat to my GP about it when I go for my shot.
If you&#039;re constipated and you&#039;re considering taking this medication, DON&#039;T. It works at relieving constipation, but the side affects are horrible. Do yourself a favor and Google home remedies for constipation, or visit your local whole food store for help to finding a solution.
My experience with Hetlioz has been very positive. I usually sleep 6-7 hours of sleep every night. Every now and then I still have a night I can&#039;t sleep very well as I think my bodies clock is still adjusting to Hetlioz. That being said when I wake up I actually feel rested (even on my bad nights). I feel like I have more energy. My digestion issues are getting better, my mood is better because I don&#039;t feel like I am exhauster. Before taking Hetloz I would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted, even if I slept thru the night. I truly was not functioning well before Hetlioz. I struggled for years with INSOMNIA. I tried many different sleeping medications with no luck until one of my doctors prescribed Hetlioz.
Made everything intense. Had me sitting on edge of seat. Took it twice, 2 doses, had to call Dr told me stop it.
I&#039;ve been on Sprintec for 3 weeks now, I&#039;ve got 3 blue pills left. I&#039;ve been on 4 different kinds of birth control in the past and I can honestly say that Sprintec has been my FAVORITE! I have had no mood swings or weight gain which is awesome. I had horrible weight gain with other birth controls. I have chronic migraines and I haven&#039;t had any increase in them or anymore acne than normal. I did have a very suppressed appetite at first, I was very hungry but would sit down to eat and just be nauseous at the thought. That only lasted a week and a half or so. My breasts have grown, which I&#039;m not complaining about at all. All in all I&#039;m very pleased and would recommend Sprintec to anyone!
I have suffered from eczema for all my life.  I have had years with little suffering and after age 60 developed eczema on my face aolng with rosacea spots.  I suffer from inverse psoriasis under my arms, breasts and inner thighs.  My condition worsens with heat, stress and certain foods and chemicals.  Over the past three weeks I&#039;m thrilled to say the eczema patches on my face and eyelids, behind my ears improved immediately, within 24 hours of using Eucrisa!  The other areas with inverse psoriasis have improved as well!  I highly recommend this product after a lifetime of so many other creams and ointments it is a miracle to have a non steriod drug!
I had my paragard inserted in the office in June of 2015. Per my OB it was in place at my 6 week check up. In the first 4 months after insertion I had moderate to severe cramping and was informed by my OB that this was normal. In June 2016 my IUD was no longer visible in my cervix. An ultrasound was scheduled. Four days later I had a positive pregnancy test. The ultrasound confirmed the pregnancy and the IUD was not visible so was assumed to have fallen out. I gave birth in February of 2017. A follow up X-ray and subsequent  hysterectomy confirmed the paragard was still in my body, but not in my uterus. I had my Paragard surgically removed in October 2017 and it was found to have perforated my uterus and small intestine.
Didn&#039;t work at all I have moderate to severe acne and this didn&#039;t work at all! Do not suggest you try it if you have acne on the face, back, and chest. Anyways hope your experience is better than mine....
My dermatologist prescribed my Tazorac 0.05% cream when no other treatment for my acne worked. To this day I still use it and it clears all my breakouts within days and leaves my skin looking even and radiant. I often spot treat with it too, for it can dry my face out sometimes. Lovely product, I highly recommend.
Everyone here has been complaining about this medication which has gotten me a little anxious as I am in the process of waiting for the effect. I took two tablets at around 6pm and around 9:30 my stomach was grumbling insanely passing wind for about half an hour. I melting toilet thinking I needed to go but i didn&#039;t. Then all of a sudden around 10pm I was in so much pain I was crouching down from the cramps and went straight to the bathroom and had a bowel movement. i am aware I might get a few more bowel movements throughout the night but at this moment I&#039;m hoping the pain isn&#039;t as unbearable as earlier before. Right now I feel quite relaxed after the first session on the toilet. Honestly feeling great after taking it.
I&#039;m on the low dose, even though I&#039;ve been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Even on the lose dose, there were days where I would go 10 times or I would have diarrhea.  My doctor didn&#039;t want to take me off it though, because this is the only thing that really has worked.  I have noticed, that the amount of water I drink while taking it/before my meal, can affect it. My doctor also thought adding a probiotic might help settle it down a bit.  I&#039;ve started taking the probiotic with Lizness and since then, I&#039;ve had more normal bowel movements.  Some days I do have more than one now, but 2-3 is not bad.  I highly suggest trying the probiotics (colon health) before discontinuing due to having too many bowel movements or diarrhea. 
I have been suffering from PMDD for years now. As I am getting older, symptoms like tender breasts, bloating, crazy cravings, fatigue, moodiness, crying, anger, have become stronger. I finally decided to talk to my obgyn about this and see if that&#039;s normal PMS or is it more serious.. She prescribed Sarafem and now I have been taking it for 2 months. I, the person that&#039;s against all drugs, am a changed person. Every day of the month my mood is the same.. I don&#039;t have any side effects most people above me stated. If you think at all that you might be suffering from PMDD, talk to your physician. It really helped me get myself back.
I also had suffered as a child with the leg movement ,also was told growing pains,and as an adult as I still had it I would pour alcohol on it an take Tylenol an in 20 minutes it was gone,an didn&#039;t come back for a few days,as I got older this has gotten so much worse ,an if you ever need a Benadryl pill lord help you cause it intenseifies  the problem ten fold the tramadol helps a lot two pills a night use to be three, but now I&#039;m on buspirone for serotonin levels, an read that tramadol raises the seratonin,that&#039;s why I take only two now but it still works good to control the rls
This medication has been a God send. Before I knew about this medication I was in and out of the bathroom at least 7 times in one day and it was every time I put food in my mouth. That went on for a full year, I couldn&#039;t go anywhere without going to the bathroom first and if I was out and about I couldn&#039;t eat anything until I got home. Me and my wife couldn&#039;t even go out to eat on our anniversary because of my problem. It was taking over my life and I was getting depressed, but then my doctor gave me Lomotil and it works like a charm. Instead of going to the bathroom after each time I put food in my mouth. I now only go about 2 times a day and I can now eat at restaurants now. Ihis medication put reassurance back in my life again.
It&#039;s been a dream since one of my boyfriends decided to use Viagra. At first I laughed at the idea but now it&#039;s great.
Works great on my nerve pains, due to diabetes.
Expensive if you buy the extended release, ($160 for 50mg twice daily a month). Not to mention very sedating, and weight gain.
I had very bad experience with Ditropan (Oxybutynin in tablets) with unacceptable side effects. After some years my GP suggested trial of Oxybutynin patches. That was the second best thing after sliced bread. Within 2 days I went from up to 6 wetting incidents per 24 hours to 0 and in the following weeks a substantial reduction in the leaking of urine. I have now used Oxytrol for 5 weeks and the only side effect is severe constipation, which seems to be helped by changing the Oxytrol patch every 5 days instead of 3 or 4. I have no other side effects, no dry mouth, no sensitive skin where the patches have been sitting on either side of the body. So I am a very satisfied user, no more large pads, nappies, PVC pants just a normal size Tena pad.
Finally, I no longer have to chose between falling asleep at night or being productive during the day.  With Sonata, I can do both.  The only drawback is that on rare occasions, the medication takes awhile to work.
I have been using Androgel pump since July 2008.  The first few months I noticed no changes with my mood, motivation or sexual interest.  The Urologist had to adjust the dose a few times to have the right blood levels of testosterone.  Once this was achieved I have been feeling great.  I noticed a big difference in my sex drive (almost a night/day difference from day one).  Lately my muscle mass has been increasing, almost like being on steroids.  I do quite a bit of manual labor and my arms have gotten huge.  I have lost just about all of the spare fat around my waist and my mood has been right on track with how I was when I was younger. I&#039;m so glad I had the motivation to seek help when I did.
Had Panic attacks for 3 years until started on Prozac.  Stopped after two weeks.  Made a wonderful difference in my anxiety and depression.
I have had bladder and kidney infections all my life, and Cipro has been a lifesaver for over 25 years. I have never experienced any side effects, and feel better within hours/days depending on the severity of my symptoms. I take Cranberry supplements on a regular basis, and it seems to aid in preventing urinary tract infections.
This med works for anxiety but....I have been on sooo many meds.  I need it more for anxiety than depression and that is why I chose Zoloft.  It does work for the anxiety only.  Problem after taking it for a couple years is my sleep is so disrupted, I clench my jaw so bad that when I wake up I have headaches, as well as my body.  I find myself all clenched up in a ball and then my body is sore from being tense, and feel foggy headed.  Newest problem is memory issues.  I guess it is this meds.  The sex was affected some... no weight gain.  Of course when you start any medicine, you have the normal, sweating, nauseous, dray mouth, but those things go away.  You have to give all medicines time to work!!!  I am going to wean off &amp; onto Cymbalta
I have tried many cholesterol lowering drugs. Crestor has been the most effective. It is the first one to bring my level under 200.
I experienced a rash over my entire body about 2-3 weeks after starting taking this medicine. I don&#039;t really know if it would have worked for me or not.
I got the Mirena implanted two days ago (Wednesday June 17, 2015) and so far it has been close to the easiest thing I&#039;ve ever had to do. I&#039;m 18 years old and I&#039;ve never had a baby, I got the Mirena to use as a form of birth control. I took 880 mg of aleve 1 hour before my appointment and the whole process took maybe 10 minutes. I&#039;ve only had one Pap smear before and she even had to dilate me a little bit but it didn&#039;t hurt worse than my worst period cramps- you just have to breathe through it. I had light spotting for the rest of the day and some mild cramps that felt better when I laid down and used a heating pad. Now I&#039;m in no pain at all and I am happy and have energy and am VERY happy that I got this done!
I tried Paroxetine, Prozac and Celexa and had no positive results so my doctor advised I try Effexor XR given it is a SNRI or different class of drug. Almost immediately &lt; 1 Week I felt a positive mood change, my social anxiety and mild stuttering seem to dissipate and I felt balanced. I have been taking Effexor XR now for almost a month now and my anxiety has dropped right off that I feel my normal self again, I am a lot more social and I stutter hardly ever and I think more logically. The only down sides are that I do sleep more and find it harder getting up in the mornings for work and have noticed fluid retention around my abdomen. I do not mind these small side effects because this drug has really helped me get my life together. :)
My symptoms were severe. Got to the point where I got up to urinate three or four times but could not go for 20 or 30 minutes and then very little volume. Took Rapaflo and it began working in minutes! Same side effects with no ejaculate and minimal satisfaction. I began to experiment and took it every other day. The relief remained the same and the ejaculate returned. Best if both worlds.
I had no trouble the first month, but had a very heavy period at the end of it and then had breakthrough bleeding all month (varying in quantity) for the second month.  I thought I&#039;d be all bled out after that and have a light period, but it was heavy again.  That was enough for me, and I switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclin Lo (which is what ended up working).  No side effects other than the breakthrough bleeding, but that was enough.
I have been on Levora for 5 years to regulate my periods. It has regulated my periods and I have a very light flow for 4 days a month. Unfortunately I have gained 40 pounds and went from a B to a D cup. I also recently saw other people&#039;s side effects and realized many of my issues are from Levora. Severe migraines, acne, needing to eat everything, mood swings, depression, etc. I am not pregnant and was happy with the pill besides the weight gain. Now that I&#039;ve realized the other issues could be from this pill, I am switching to Mirena next week.
On day 5 of 29 on day 5 of 290 milligram linzess all I have experienced is a lot of gas last evening my stomach was extremely distended not sure if this is going to work for me but I&#039;m not going to give up the fight the constipation is severe and causes major problems in daily living so I&#039;m going to hold on until my next doctor&#039;s appointment
The smell is deceiving, it smells sweet and fruity NOT!!.  It is just one of the nastiest things I&#039;ve ever put in my month.   Although I did chase it with gatarade which seemed to wash away suprep after taste.    The diarrhea wasn&#039;t any thing I  haven&#039;t had before.  This is my second colonoscopy.   Was more worried about the prep that the procedure.   The lemon lime stuff I drank the first time was way better tasting.  If you have a weak stomach ask for something else.
I&#039;ve suffered from migraines since I was a little girl, more then 40 years. I saw a variety of doctors over the years and they tried many different combinations of medications to help but none were successful. Finally one doctor included Fiorinal/codeine to my meds to help when I had a migraine! Success! Something worked! If I take this at the start of a migraine it helps 100% of the time. I&#039;ve been able to take part in all activities without having to cancel due to an uncontrollable migraine!

My husband was diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer in October 2012.  He had surgery to remove 1/3 of his lung, chemo and radiation. In July 2013 had a double by pass surgery.  July 2014, it matastised to the brain.  Gamma knife shrunk the 2 tumors  In September 2014 started another round of chemo, but 2 months later he had a TIA, they took him off the chemo.  In September 2016 started Opdivo.  Doing well no new tumors in the lungs or brain.  Side effects are severe tiredness, sleeps all the time, body aches, depression.  His quality of life is very bad .  The depression really worries me.  Has any one else been dealing with depression and severe mood swings on this drug?
5 yrs ago, I got Amerge after trying almost every other medication available. My migraines tend to come back within 4-6 hours with Imitrex, but the Amerge would keep it gone. Unfortunately, I had a really hard time getting my insurance to cover it. Another good thing about the Amerge is that it didn&#039;t seem to have the photophobia effect after I took it. Also wouldn&#039;t knock me out or make me feel groggy. It was like taking a vitamin and then my life could just go on as planned! I really hope that insurance companies get better at covering effective medications for their patients. I also wish I could just afford the $200 or whatever for 9 pills. 
Although there should be no negative drug interaction with this antibiotic and other medication I take daily, I had a severe allergic reaction: swelling of throat and tongue, vertigo and dizziness, bad taste in my mouth (even days after) and vomiting. I&#039;m on my third day of the medication now and still feel sick and &quot;weird&quot;. My throat and tongue are no longer swollen, but all my muscles hurt and my skin feels painful, also major headache and very sleepy. 
I was on it for 2 years and never had any problems.  My periods were predictable and it decreased my cramping and bleeding.  I still had a period for 6 days but with light bleeding, it&#039;s not that bad.
I developed a very specific form of OCD in my early 50&#039;s that is commonly described as &quot;Ear Worms&quot;.  It is where a song or a snippet of a song gets stuck in your head and keeps playing over and over.  It got so bad it was literally driving me insane.  I would have a snippet playing nonstop for WEEKS!  Day and night (kept me awake until I fell asleep from exhaustion).  Played at work CONSTANTLY where I couldn&#039;t focus.  I would be in meetings unable to pay attention because I would have a song blaring over and over in my head.  After ramping up doses, I settled at 100mg/day of Zoloft which has SAVED MY LIFE!  It works!  I can listen to music again and not yell at my wife when she sings.  And I have no side effects.
I don&#039;t know if I should sit on the toilet and make this stuff come out it is so uncomfortable.   Itchy,  burning, ouch!

Right after my daughters 13 yr. birthday, she had severe bleeding and was diagnosed with severe crohns and colitis.  She has been on Remicade since January and has infusions every six weeks.  She was on put on Prednisone in March since the infusions did not stop the bleeding alone.  She is now being weened off the steroids, Thank God, and is on Remicade for the rest if ths year for now.  She gets a boost of energy and after her infusions, but is very smart about what she can and cant eat. Prayers to u all going through this.
I only take 5mg of Saphris in the morning plus Estroven that helps my anger and it has helped me a lot. I used to take 10mg but gave me suicidal thoughts so I just take 5mg in the morning only taking it day by day. 
This is a review from the care taker side, my wife Lori had been diagnosed with MS since 1996, she had been on Betaseron till 2011 when she switched to Gilenya. Over time she experienced hearing, vision, memory loss and extreme fatigue which all got worse, she was sleeping 16 to 18 hrs a day. I didn&#039;t realise these changes until she was got off Gilynea July 2016, over 6 months time she is a different person. So Gilynea worked, but it changes a person over time, in my case for the worse, she just took her first set of Lemtrada infusion, and in 1 year she will do her last set, and will not need a MS treatment again, we have high hopes for the future and looks promising so far.
I got the Implanon in October 2009 three weeks after giving birth to my second son. At first I did get anxiety pretty bad but it went away quickly. My periods pretty much stopped. Every once in a while I will get a normal period. But for the last month and a half I have been having horrible headaches, no sex drive, mood swings but worst of all I have been having random pains all over my body. My doctor says its neurological. I have had an MRI ultrasound and all kinds of blood work. 
I got the nexplanon after I had my daughter in 2014. I bled constant for eight months straight. I then went to sporatic periods (on one week, spot the next, nothing a few days, then BAM back to bleeding)  I have gained 30 pounds on this and can not lose it for the life of me, no diet or exercise regimen will work. Also, I have been battling depression and dissociation off and on since I got it. However,  I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant. So it definitely does it&#039;s job. But I finally am scheduled to get it out next week, one year early. I will not ever get it again. Everyone will react differently.
I used to use warm soapy water as this is what I received as a child and continued as an adult.  Now I use a fleet enema and it works just as well with less bother. This is also great when traveling. No bag to hang and nozzle and hose to wash.   
Over the past few years I have tried all the medication for a overactive bladder that is available through my doctors. This medication for me is the best one, it works really well and I have no symptoms of an overactive bladder and helps with my bladder leaking. The only reason I did not give it 10/10 is the side effects dry mouth, thirst, and I do feel very tired when taking this tablet.
I wanted to try this because pills just were not working for me and I decided a non-hormonal IUD would be my best bet. Insertion was pretty painful and I had to rest for around 15 minutes before I could actually stand up and walk. I have had it for 3 months now and I am a person that will try something for as long as possible before I have had enough. Lower back pain, painful cramps, period that lasts 2 weeks where I bleed through super tampons in two hours, and spotting for the other 2 weeks. Crouching down for longer then 30 seconds as well as sitting on hard chairs means having painful cramps for the day. For this much pain, not worth it. Does prevent pregnancy though.
This helps me calm down and sleep at night when I&#039;m manic, but I noticed a weight gain of 10 lbs and I feel sluggish during the day. I also dream more often, which may or may not be a desirable side effect.
I was on Desogen for 7 years and never got pregnant, had shorter, lighter periods. All medicines have side effects that being said; the down side was slight increase of my blood pressure &amp; slight weight gain. When I was ready to start my family it only took me 2 months to get pregnant. Now I have to be on a different pill because I&#039;ve had my baby &amp; our hormones change but haven&#039;t found a pill that works as well as Desogen did.
I&#039;m 34 ...5&#039; 4&quot;.  I had jitters, nausea, severe constipation, and trouble concentrating. This was going on through the first month. Starting the second month of Contrave,  I have NO side effects. 
I only give it a few points because I was put on it to regulate periods which it has done. But this BC has made my cramps severe to the point of near vomitting. My emotions drastically switch in an instant. I haven&#039;t been able to sleep much since being on it.
The side effects can be quite bad, the generic was the same for me as well. 
diagnosed with brain cancer four years ago at age 32, Surgery, Temodar and radiation worked for first couple years, then I got two more tumors, stopped Temodar and started Avastin. In just two months I&#039;ve seen dramatic improvements with minimal side effects (constipation, nose bleeds and mouth sores) all of which have responded to simple remedies) My last brain scan was a large improvement over the prior one and I&#039;ve reduced my Dexamethasone dose substantially! I highly recommend!
I receive inapsine or droperidol in an ER visit to assess a small gastric bleed related to gastroparesis. The nausea and vomiting had persisted for 2 days.  However, within 10 minutes of the drug administration, I became severely restless and unable to remain in the bed. I suffered the worst episode of restless leg syndrome in my life, but it involved my upper body and arms, too!. I paced, stretched, and moved constantly trying to achieve some comfort. I became repeatedly tangled in the IV tubing.  Finally, I relaxed after having received several IV or IM doses of diazepam. I remained awake at home until the following morning.
This has been very helpful with the pain I experience with muscle spasms. I do like the relief of stiffness I have everyday.
Seemed to work okay for me.
